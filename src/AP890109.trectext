   First lady Nancy Reagan was saluted Monday night
for her sense of style and her contribution to the American fashion
industry.
   Mrs. Reagan was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by
the Council of Fashion Designers of America at its eighth annual
awards ceremony, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
   ``There are many pluses and minuses to being in the White House.
One of the pluses is trying to help an industry that is one of the
most important in our country and I think the American fashion
designers are the best,'' said the first lady, who was wearing a
brilliant red floor-length gown designed by Oscar de la Renta.
   ``And when I found myself in the position to make others aware of
that, or at least try to, I was delighted to do so,'' she added.
   Broadcaster Barbara Walters, in presenting the award to Mrs.
Reagan, said the first lady and the president, during his eight
years in office, ``gave us pride, gave us hope, gave us style ...
that intriguing, all-encompassing word that says so much. Style.
Presence. A sense of beauty. ... Nancy Reagan has style.''
   Prior to the awards ceremony, de la Renta, president of the
council, said of Mrs. Reagan: ``I think she put American fashion on
the pedestal where it belongs and brought elegance back to American
fashion.''
   Designer Donna Karan said of Mrs. Reagan: ``The contribution to
fashion she has made goes beyond her clothing to her sense of
sophistication, caring and elegance as first lady of the United
States.''
   Calvin Klein, accompanied by his wife Kelly, said: ``She has
shown how women can look so well-groomed, so attractive and so
American.''
   Mrs. Reagan has been criticized for borrowing much of her
high-priced wardrobe while living at the White House _ a practice
critics said amounted to free advertising for the designers whose
clothes she wore.
   But Ms. Walters said she thought a first lady should be
``encouraged to borrow'' because it ``stimulates American industry.''
   Her comment caused the 500 ceremony guests to applaud vigorously.
   Mrs. Reagan had worn the de la Renta gown she wore to the
ceremony on at least three other occasions, said Wendy Toler, a
spokeswoman for the first lady.
   Also among those recognized at the ceremony was designer Geoffrey
Beene, who was saluted for making ``fashion as art.''
   Performer Liza Minelli, one of many women attending the ceremony
who dressed in Mrs. Reagan's favorite color, red, presented the
Perry Ellis award for new fashion talent to Isaac Mizrahi, whom she
called ``a brilliant and startling talent.''
   Ms. Minelli wore a floor-length gown with a leg-revealing slit
designed by Mizrahi.
   Actress Audrey Hepburn, wearing a red gown designed by Givenchy,
presented a Lifetime Achievement Award to photographer Richard
Avedon, for his ``pictorial contribution to American fashion and his
photographic reportage of historical events.''
   Bill Robinson received the award for menswear design. Nina Hyde,
fashion editor of The Washington Post, was recognized for her
reporting on American fashion.
   Karl Lagerfeld, designer for the house of Chanel, received a
special award for his international fashion influence.
   Grace Mirabella, former editor-in-chief of Vogue magazine, was
recognized for her promotion of American fashion in the media.
   Judith Peabody, a member of the board of directors of the Gay
Men's Health Crisis Inc., received the council's special
humanitarian award.

<HEAD>Former Nazi Propagandist Seeks Refuge In Canada</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Yale University lecturer who was
stripped of his American citizenship in 1986 for his role as a Nazi
propagandist in the Soviet Union during World War II has asked for
refugee status in Canada, a report said Monday.
   Vladimir Sokolov disappeared in July when he was scheduled to
appear at a deportation hearing in Hartford, Conn.
   His whereabouts were unknown until he applied for refugee status
in Montreal sometime before Jan. 1, claiming that his life would be
in danger if he was forced to return to the Soviet Union, the
Canadian Broadcast Corp. reported.
   No date has been set for an immigration hearing, the report said.
   From 1942 to 1944, Sokolov was a writer and editor of a Russian
language newspaper published by the German army in his hometown of
Orel, 220 miles south of Moscow. Anti-Semitic articles appeared
under his name, although he has maintained that the most offensive
tracts were written by Nazi censors.
   His Canadian lawyer, Julius Grey, said Sokolov faces almost
certain death if deported to the Soviet Union.
   ``The Soviet press has been gloating over his return and have
called him a traitor,'' Grey said. ``He would likely be put to death
or given a lengthy sentence. For all practical purposes it would be
the end of his life.''
   Grey, a noted constitutional lawyer who is also defending
convicted murderer John Joseph Kindler from extradition to the
United States where he faces the death penalty, said the 75-year-old
Sokolov is in very poor health.
   Sokolov failed to reveal his wartime activities in 1951 when he
entered the United States as a displaced person. He became a citizen
in 1957 and two years later began lecturing on Russian language and
Soviet dissident literature at Yale.
   His past was uncovered by the Yale student paper in 1976 and he
later resigned. But the U.S. government waited until 1982 before
filing a complaint to strip him of his American citizenship.

<TEXT>
   Four former Ku Klux Klan members entered
guilty pleas in federal court Monday for their part in a violent
clash in 1979 with black marchers.
   The four were the last of nine former Klan members who were
indicted and eventually pleaded guilty to federal charges stemming
from the gunfire in a Decatur parade that wounded several people.
   There were no fatal injuries in the 1979 confrontation. The
wounded included police officers.
   Two of the former Klansmen _ Ray Winford Steele and William
Riccio _ pleaded guilty Monday to a felony count of obstruction of
justice and a misdemeanor count of conspiring to violate civil
rights.
   The other two _ William Johnny Mason and Lynwood White _ pleaded
guilty to the misdemeanor conspiracy count.
   The former Klansmen were accused of blocking a Southern Christian
Leadership Conference march on May 26, 1979. The marchers were
protesting the prosecution of a mentally retarded black man charged
with the rape of a white woman in Decatur.
   The misdemeanor conspiracy count carries a maximum sentence of
one year in prison and a $1,000 fine. The felony count carries a
maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   U.S. District Judge John Hancock delayed sentencing for up to a
month.

<HEAD>1986 Tax Reform Benefits Farmers When Income Grows, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department analyst says the 1986
tax reforms can mean substantial savings to farmers when incomes
rise but that the old federal rules allowed bigger breaks as
earnings decline.
   Clifford V. Rossi of the department's Economic Research Service
said the Tax Reform Act of 1986 can reduce overall tax liability for
farmers by an average of 4.5 percent from previous levels.
   Rossi used a computer model and information from more than 15,000
federal tax returns of ``farm sole proprietorships'' for 1982 to
come up with the estimates. His findings were in a new staff report
circulated by the agency.
   Farm sole proprietorships were defined as ``self-employed
individuals filing a Schedule F federal tax form,'' which is the
basic paperwork required of farmers by the Internal Revenue Service.
   ``In general, lower marginal tax rates and generous expensing
provisions will offset repeal of the investment tax credit and
capital gains preference,'' the report said. ``Taxpayers with high
off-farm incomes receive little benefit from the new law.''
   Rossi noted that farm incomes can vary greatly because of
weather, economic conditions and other factors. So he performed a
``sensitivity analysis'' that includes a 25 percent increase and
another that includes a 25 percent decrease on farm income.
   The increase in net farm income resulted in a 10.9 percent
increase in federal tax liability under the old rules and only an
8.3 percent increase under the 1985 law, he said.
   By contrast, Rossi showed that a 25 percent drop in income would
result in a decline of 8.7 percent in taxes under the old federal
system and only 7.7 percent less under the new reforms.
   ``In terms of net winners and losers from tax reform, taxpayers
engaged in field crop and general livestock operations benefit more
from the new tax laws than other farm groups,'' he said. ``All
sectors, with the exception of the dairy sector, experience net
reductions in tax liabilities under tax reform.''
   Rossi said dairy farmers suffer under the new tax law ``because
of low taxable incomes that consequently cannot offset the loss of
capital gains preference'' and investment tax credit, two of the
major writeoffs under the old law.
   ``Farm enterprises with relatively high capital intensities are
burdened more by the loss of certain preferences for capital
intensities than other farm operations,'' he said. ``There is also
some evidence that more generous expensing and depreciation
provisions are of greater consequence to capital-intensive
operations than other farm types.''
   Rossi said the 1986 law ``tends to reduce tax burdens for
taxpayers with low and moderate levels of income'' and that those
whose taxable incomes were more than $500,000 showed the smallest
decline in taxes.
   According to Rossi, the new study is ``the only comprehensive
assessment of tax liability in the agricultural sector'' and will
aid in future policy considerations.
   ``If history is any indicator of future activity in tax policy,
the Tax Reform Act of 1986 will undergo refinement or overhaul in
the years ahead with accompanying effects on agriculture,'' he said.

   Tokyo continues to be the most expensive world
capital for groceries, according to the Agriculture Department.
   A 16-city survey by the department's Foreign Agricultural Service
in November showed that a retail market basket of selected food
items cost more than $144 in Tokyo, while the lowest cost was in
Brasilia at $27. In Washington, D.C., the same items were about $53.
   In order, the 16 capitals and market basket costs included:
Tokyo, $144.10; Stockholm, $99.92; Bern, $96.62; Seoul, $63.25;
Madrid, $59.64; Paris, $56.89; Rome, $58.64; London, $55.63;
Washington, D.C., $53.26; Bonn, $51.59; Canberra, $49.77; Ottawa,
$49.41; Buenos Aires, $40.99; Mexico City, $31.94; Pretoria, $31.17;
and Brasilia, $27.08.
   The agency said the food items ``reflect purchases more typical
of U.S. consumers rather than those of other nations'' and that
caution should be used in making comparisons. Differences in
quality, packaging and seasonal variations in supply were cited.
   Among the items, sirloin steak was shown at $10.71 per kilogram,
or about $4.87 per pound, in Washington, D.C., and $57.06 per
kilogram, or $26 per pound in Tokyo. In Brasilia, sirloin was $2.75
per kilo, or $1.25 per pound.
   The comparisons were begun by USDA many years ago to bolster
claims that Americans pay lower prices for food than many other
people in the world.

   Rising food prices in China may help spur
greater interest in imported U.S. farm commodities, according to an
Agriculture Department trade report.
   ``The combination of rising incomes, inflation fears and the
expression of pent-up consumer demand for almost everything has
created a sellers' market for most agricultural goods as well,''
according to the report in the January issue of Ag Exporter magazine.
   Higher prices for grain, livestock and dairy products are
expected to encourage imports of breeding animals, feed grains,
soybeans and meal, and wheat and wheat flour, the report said.

   One of every three men and women walking down
the aisle in the United States has been married before, but the
remarriage rate for divorced Americans has been declining, according
to a National Center for Health Statistics report.
   The government report also shows that most divorced men marry
divorced women and that of those divorced Americans remarrying in
1983, the women were on the average 34 years old and the men, an
average 37 years old.
   The report is based on samples of records from states that
compile marriage and divorce statistics. It studies data collected
from 1970 to 1983, the latest year for which most of the figures
were available.
   The number of remarriages increased during the period studied,
rising from 404,000 in 1970 to 736,000 in 1983 for divorced women
and from 423,000 to 773,000 over the 14-year period for divorced men.
   But although the number of remarriages was growing over those
years, the pool of divorced men and women was growing faster, the
report said.
   In 1983, the remarriage rate for divorced women was 91.6 per
1,000 compared with 123.3 per 1,000 in 1970. The rate for divorced
men was 142.1 per 1,000 compared with 204.5 per 1,000 in 1970, the
report said.
   ``Thus, only 9 percent of divorced women and 14 percent of
divorced men remarried in 1983, compared with 12 percent of divorced
women and 20 percent of divorced men in 1970,'' the report said.
   The figures also show that most women marry men of the same
marital status. In 1983, the report said, 55 percent of all women
and men who married were both single, 19 percent were both divorced
and 2 percent were both widowed.
   Men traditionally are older than the women they marry, and this
generally holds true for remarriages as well as first marriages,
according to the study. The only combinations in which that trend is
broken is for divorced and widowed women who marry single men. In
1983, widowed women were an average 2 years older and divorced women
were an average 1 year older than the single men they married.
   Many of the patterns for first marriages don't hold up for second
and subsequent marriages, the report noted.
   While more than three-quarters of first marriages are performed
in religious settings, the proportion drops to about 60 percent for
marriages involving divorced men and women.
   Also, first marriages have a typical seasonal pattern _ many more
are performed in the summer than in the winter, the report said. But
second and subsequent marriages tend to be spread more evenly
throughout the year.

   Two employees of a McDonald's Restaurant
were fatally shot during a robbery Sunday and a suspect was arrested
hours later at a Wilmington, Del., bus station, officials said.
   Robert P. Hughes IV, 21, of Glen Mills, was arrested at about
8:40 a.m., said Wilmington police Sgt. Richard Andress. Hughes was
charged with resisting arrest, carrying a concealed deadly weapon
and was held as a fugitive, Andress said.
   In Pennsylvania, Hughes was charged with two counts of murder,
two counts of criminal homicide, robbery and weapons violations,
said James P. MacElree II, Chester County district attorney.
   Extradition proceedings probably will begin this week, Andress
said.
   Restaurant manager Jean Reider, 41, of Newark, Del., and Charles
Hegarty, 46, of West Chester, were killed in the holdup, which
occurred before the restaurant had opened, police said.

<TEXT>
   Fear that the U.S. government will go it alone
in world trade is discouraging other countries from joining in an
accord that could cut spending on farmers by tens of billions of
dollars every year, according to a report published by the
International Monetary Fund.
   Fund experts see a possibility that James M. Baker III,
designated as secretary of state by President-elect Bush, will
single out favored countries as trading partners instead of
promoting U.S. trade with the whole world.
   The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, whose
members include the governments of the major industrial countries,
says farm subsidies cost consumers and taxpayers $185 billion a year
between 1984 and 1986. The biggest costs are in the United States,
western Europe and Japan.
   The IMF report cites a speech last year by Baker, then secretary
of the treasury. Baker spoke of what the U.S. government would do if
there were a failure of the trade talks now being held by
representatives of 96 countries.
   ``We might be willing to explore a `market liberalization club'
approach, through mini-lateral arrangements or a series of bilateral
agreements,'' Bush was quoted as saying.
   Bilateral agreements are like the new one between the United
States and Canada, freeing up trade between two countries but
tending to freeze out others. A similar deal with Israel was made
earlier last year. A ``mini-lateral'' arrangement includes not just
two but a group of countries, like the 12 in the European Economic
Community.
   Groups of this kind encourage trade among members at the expense
of those outside the club.
   The report was written before last month's meeting in Montreal of
representatives from the 96 governments. They agreed on how to
negotiate 11 different kinds of trade issues in the remaining two
years of talks. But they failed to agree on four others, including
agriculture.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter insisted that other
governments, especially the Europeans, promise to join in a
long-term phase-out of subsidies before he would talk about cutting
them in the immediate future. Bush has picked Yeutter as his
secretary of agriculture.
   On Thursday Alan Holmer, Yeutter's deputy as trade
representative, said he was optimistic about agreement being reached
on farm issues by April, a new deadline set at Montreal. But
negotiations are being soured by a fight between the European
community and the Reagan administration over the hormones that U.S.
farmers use to make their cattle grow faster.
   Last Sunday the community, which tries to keep its own farmers
from using hormones, banned imports of U.S. beef and veal worth over
$100 million a year. The Reagan administration retaliated with
increases of 100 percent in import duties on such items as Danish
hams and sun-dried tomatoes from Italy, a measure designed to make
them too expensive for Americans to want to buy. The Europeans are
threatening a counter-reprisal and U.S. officials say they have a
list ready should that happen.
   A truce is in effect at least until Jan. 23, when ministers of
foreign affairs from the 12 countries are due to meet in Brussels.
Bush will have been inaugurated three days earlier and the new
administration may have some ideas for getting the talks back on the
rails. Yeutter is to be replaced as trade representative by Carla
Hills.
   The report published by the International Monetary Fund is called
``Issues and Developments in International Trade Policy.'' It was
written by a team under Margaret Kelly, an Australian who heads the
fund's Trade and Payments Division.
   The fund is owned by 151 countries, with the United States
holding the biggest block of votes.

   General Douglas MacArthur and others directing
the occupation of Japan after World War II resisted powerful U.S.
and allied opposition in keeping the late Emperor Hirohito on the
chrysanthemum throne, where he reigned for another 43 years.
   The emperor's prosecution for war crimes, execution, imprisonment
or exile was favored by 70 percent of Americans in a public opinion
poll seven weeks before the end of the war. Some allied governments
had similar views.
   MacArthur, supreme commander of the U.S. occupation of Japan, was
the best known of those resisting demands for punishing the monarch
who died in Tokyo Saturday at the age of 87 after a 62-year reign
marked by military expansion, crushing defeat, reconciliation,
dramatic economic growth and new heights of prosperity and prestige
for his country.
   Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and six other Japanese officials were
convicted and hanged as a result of the Tokyo war crimes trials.
Tojo's testimony at one point threatened to implicate the emperor in
whose name the militarists had overrun East Asia.
   Documents released in Washington 25 years ago by the State
Department show that MacArthur and other U.S. officials decided
retention of Hirohito was vital to maintaining order in the former
enemy country and carrying out their mission of democratic reform.
   But those planning Japan's future were also aware that the
emotions of war had generated powerful sentiment in America and
other allied countries for prosecuting and ousting the mikado as
responsible for aggression and atrocities of the imperial military
command, the documents showed.
   George Gallup, director of the American Institute of Public
Opinion, declared June 23, 1945, that ``the average American''
thinks Hirohito ``should be treated like any other war criminal.''
   In his latest Gallup poll, he said, 33 percent of those
questioned said Hirohito should be executed, 17 percent said ``let
the court decide his fate,'' 11 percent said ``keep him in prison
the rest of his life'' and 9 percent wanted to exile him. Only 4
percent favored ignoring him as a mere figurehead, 3 percent said
``use him as a puppet to run Japan.'' Other replies or no opinion
accounted for 23 percent.
   MacArthur wrote in his memoirs that Hirohito had already been
stricken from the list of potential war crimes defendants when the
monarch first visited him Sept. 30, 1945. Hands trembling, the
emperor offered to bear sole responsibility for the war, MacArthur
wrote, adding that, ``I knew I faced the First Gentleman of Japan in
his Own Right.''
   Four months later, the five-star general messaged Washington that
Hirohito's indictment and execution could trigger a convulsion,
potential chaos and guerrilla warfare in Japan. One million
occupation troops might be needed and ``all hope of introducing
democratic methods would disappear,'' MacArthur said.
   George Atcheson Jr., MacArthur's State Department adviser, told
Truman in 1946: ``There is no question that the emperor is most
useful. He is obeyed ... he manifests sincerity in wishing to aid in
the accomplishment of our general objectives and is seemingly more
anxious to be democratic than some of the people around him.''
   A specialist strongly advocating retention of the emperor was
Hugh Borton, member of the U.S. State-War-Navy coordinating
committee in Washington that began studies before the end of the war
on occupation policy and sent its findings to MacArthur.
   Reached at his home in Conway, Mass., Borton, now 83, said the
committee favored keeping Hirohito on the basis of expert opinion
that ``he was one who could more influence the Japanese populace
than anyone else, and the important thing for the United States was
to make the occupation as effective as possible rather than a
continuation of the war.''
   First indications, in August 1945, that the emperor might be
retained produced a strong but mixed reaction in Congress. Sen. Tom
Stewart D-Tenn., said the emperor is ``a war criminal and I'd like
to see him hung up by his toes.''
   Sen. William Langer, R-N.D., said the emperor ``ought to be
treated like Hitler.''
   Sen. Richard Russell, D-Ga., who later introduced an unsuccessful
resolution urging trial of the emperor, called anything less than
unconditional surrender ``a terrible mistake.''
   But Sens. Styles Bridges, R-N.H., Elbert Thomas, D-Utah, and
Robert Taft, R-Ohio, said it should be possible to deal sternly and
effectively with Japan and simplify military operations by working
through the emperor.

   President Reagan's submission today of his
$1.15 trillion federal budget for fiscal 1990 triggers a work
schedule that is specified by law, cited with reverence by lawmakers
and then routinely ignored.
   This year should be no different.
   The law calls for Congress to have completed work on the spending
plan by April 15. In addition, all 13 appropriations bills that
finance the federal government are supposed to be in place by the
Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year.
   But that rarely happens, and ingredients for delay abound this
year.
   Congress will be treating Reagan's proposal as largely
inconsequential and waiting for a new plan from President-elect Bush
after his inauguration. The House Budget Committee isn't even
planning any hearings on Reagan's blueprint and will wait instead
until it receives something from Bush.
   In addition, Bush's repeated pledges to avoid new taxes puts him
in direct conflict with many congressional leaders who say the
additional revenues will be unavoidable.
   ``There probably hasn't been a year in the last five where the
likelihood of keeping to the budget schedule is less likely,'' says
Stanley E. Collender, the Washington-based director of federal
budget policy for the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse.
   This hasn't stopped top members of Congress from their usual
pledges to move quickly on the budget.
   Last Monday, Congress' first day in session, House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, set a goal of meeting budget deadlines and said,
``So far as the speaker can influence the schedule, we shall perform
our work on time.''
   And new Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser, D-Tenn.,
expressed the same desire in a telephone interview last week, adding
that the delay caused by the presidential transition ``doesn't waive
the provisions of the law'' setting the budget work schedule.
   But history shows that fiscal and political crises, not
timetables, govern the budget process.
   Budget deadlines set by law come and go with no real consequences
if they are missed.
   But three key fiscal events are scheduled to occur roughly
simultaneously this fall and are likely to spur action in what
Collender, borrowing from the language of New Age adherents, calls
``the political equivalent of the harmonic convergence.''
   Sometime this August or September, the government is expected to
reach its debt ceiling of $2.8 trillion, meaning that legislation
will be needed for it to be able to borrow more money.
   At the same time, if there is no budget agreement between
Congress and the White House, the mechanism will begin that
ultimately triggers the dreaded automatic spending slashes required
under the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. Those cuts _ which are
seen by most people as draconian _ would take effect Oct. 1.
   In addition, September is the last month of the fiscal year. Some
sort of legislation that provides money must be in place by Oct. 1
or the government cannot function.
   Stalemates are common when it comes to the budget because the
blueprint is the most basic statement of the government's
priorities. It not only perpetually creates institutional struggles
between the executive and legislative branches, but it is a
battleground for Democrats and Republicans positioning themselves
for future elections.
   Last year was unusual for its budget harmony because most of the
crucial decisions were made at a summit among Reagan administration
officials and congressional leaders shortly after the October 1987
stock market crash. It was the first year in 12 in which all 13
spending bills were finished by Oct. 1.
   In 1987, spending legislation was not completed until nearly
Christmas, three months into the fiscal year.

   Prince Charles has angered British farmers by
linking intensive farming methods with erosion and the destruction
of wildlife.
   ``People are becoming increasingly concerned about the damage to
the environment arising from the application by farmers of the
principle of the maximization of production,'' he said in an address
to an organic food production conference this weekend.
   ``It is increasingly felt by members of the public that
large-scale soil erosion, the destruction of wildlife habitat and
the excessive use of chemicals and unnatural substances are
unacceptable and cannot continue without ruining the countryside for
future generations and probably causing long-term health hazards.''
   National Farmers' Union President Simon Gourlay said the prince
had ``gone over the top in sounding the alarm bells and I do not
think he's justified in saying there's a buildup of long-term
environmental problems.''
   Charles has shown a penchant for voicing public concerns, most
notably in the field of urban development and architecture.

   Shoes have put former U.S. Rep. John
Jenrette back in the news.
   The South Carolina Democrat, who was convicted in 1980 in the
FBI's Abscam investigation, faces charges of petty larceny for the
theft of a pair of shoes and for altering price tags at a suburban
Washington, D.C., department store, authorities said.
   He is scheduled to go to trial in Fairfax County, Va., on Feb. 1,
said his lawyer, Warren McLain.
   ``It was a silly, silly mistake,'' Jenrette said Saturday, adding
that if he hadn't lost his temper over the Dec. 7 incident, the
arrest ``probably wouldn't have happened.''
   Jenrette said he was trying on a pair of rubber work shoes at the
store when he heard that cars parked outside were being towed. He
said he walked outside with the shoes on because he thought he had
parked his car in a ``questionable area.''
   Two security guards immediately ``jumped on me,'' Jenrette said.
An argument ensued and ``the next thing I knew they signed a
warrant.''
   Jenrette also denied charges that he altered prices on a pair of
pants and a shirt from a clearance table.
   Following Abscam, his former wife, Rita, appeared seminude in
Playboy. She wrote a book about how she and Jenrette made love at
the U.S. Capitol and how she found $25,000 stuffed in his brown
suede shoe.

   Thirteen-year-old Drew Barrymore, the lovable
little girl in the movie ``E.T.,'' said agents hired by her mother
put her in handcuffs to take her back to the hospital after her
binge of substance abuse.
   In September, she said, she took a break from her initial
hospital stay for drug and alcohol use to audition for a play in New
York, and broke her 88-day string of sobriety when she snorted
cocaine in a nightclub restroom.
   She said she then stole her mother's credit card, flew to Los
Angeles, snorting more cocaine, and went on a shopping spree.
   Her mother hired private agents who handcuffed her and sent her
back to the hospital, according to her first-person account in this
week's People magazine.
   She said her descent into drug and alcohol abuse began with her
rise in fame. ``From the time I became famous in `E.T.,' my life got
really weird,'' Miss Barrymore said.
   Miss Barrymore was released from her second stay at a
drug-and-alcohol rehabilitation hospital shortly before Christmas.
She said she drank at age 9, smoked marijuana at 10 and snorted
cocaine at 12.
   ``It was frightening. I was this 7-year-old who was expected to
be going on a mature 29,'' she said. ``By the time I was 8{, I felt
like I was some abnormal, crazy girl. I could walk up to the door of
any nightclub and they'd say, `Hi, you're that little girl. Come
in.'''
   Last June, after a beer binge, Miss Barrymore had a showdown with
her mother and ``started throwing things _ glasses, vases. They were
breaking all over the floor. I went from party girl to jerk of the
planet.''

   Singer Chuck Berry thinks the nondescript terra
cotta building at 2120 S. Michigan Ave. should take its rightful
place as a historic location in the development of urban blues.
   ``I recorded some of my biggest hits at that address,'' Berry
recalled recently. ``I have a lot of memories of it. They were great
days of great music.''
   The building once was the mecca for the nation's blues musicians
_ the home of Chess Records. This week, the Commission on Chicago
Landmarks will consider the nomination of the two-story building for
city landmark status.
   During the 1950s and 1960s, passersby might have seen Howlin'
Wolf, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, the Dells, or the Rev. C.L. Franklin
and his daughter, Aretha.
   Bluesman Willie Dixon said he would like to make the building the
national headquarters for his Blues Heaven Foundation, which raises
money for music scholarships, and perhaps a blues museum.
   ``It is part of the history of America,'' Dixon said. ``Remember,
all rock is the blues by rearrangement. And the blues should have a
place, a home, so the world knows where they came from.''

<HEAD>Town Looks To City-Owned Utility For Lower Electric Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCH WEISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLYDE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city manager is on the verge of flipping a
switch that will send electricity flowing through city-owned power
lines, a change he says will save money for residents of this
northern Ohio town.
   But officials for the Toledo Edison Co., which now supplies
electricity to the town's 5,600 residents, say a municipal power
system will be unreliable and electric rates will eventually
increase and surpass their rates.
   City Manager Nelson Summit admits that the Clyde Light and Power
Co. is a gamble.
   ``What it boiled down to was I felt there was a better way to
provide electricity. It turned out that it is going to be cheaper
and rates will get a lot better in the future,'' Summit said in a
recent interview.
   But Toledo Edison is putting up a fight.
   It filed a lawsuit last month after the city refused to start
negotiating the renewal of the private company's franchise to serve
the city. The contract expires in June 1990.
   Toledo Edison wants to force Clyde to explain to the state Public
Utilities Commission why the company should not be allowed to
compete with the new municipal system in Clyde, about 30 miles
southeast of Toledo.
   Toledo Edison will lose about $7 million to $8 million annually
in revenues if the franchise is not renewed, said Mark Everhart,
general manager of the utility's eastern district.
   The utility has 275,000 customers in northwestern Ohio. ``Losing
Clyde is kind of like cutting the heart out of a distribution
system,'' he said.
   The conversion to a city-owned system had its beginnings five
years ago when Summit moved to Clyde and saw his electric bills
double.
   Voters in November 1987 approved a $10 million bond issue to set
up the utility company. Early last year, the city agreed to buy
power wholesale from the Canton-based Ohio Power Co. at 3.1 cents
per kilowatt hour.
   The city wanted to buy Toledo Edison's distribution system, but
the company's selling price of $30 million was too high, Summit said.
   Now, Clyde is building a new substation, distribution and
transmission lines. Its first customer, a Whirlpool Corp. plant, is
expected to be on line in early March, Summit said.
   The City Council recently set rates for the new system at 7 cents
per kilowatt hour. The current rate is 9.5 cents and the average
household pays $52 a month. That's expected to drop to $39.
   More than 80 Ohio communities have municipal electric systems,
most buying power wholesale from utilities, but no municipal system
has been set up since the early 1900s.
   Clyde's operation is being closely watched by other Ohio
municipalities interested in cutting electric rates.
   ``There is no doubt about it, a precedent has already been set
and Toledo Edison is worried,'' Summit said.
   But there are several inherent problems with municipal power
systems, Everhart said. In coming years, some cities may have
trouble buying power wholesale because supplies will diminish, the
utility company official said.
   ``A no-frill utility company will work fine until the wind blows
hard, until there is a major accident and until something goes
wrong. And then all of a sudden, you are left holding the bag,''
said Everhart.

   A Belfast-bound jetliner carrying 126
people crashed beside a highway in central England on Sunday and
broke into pieces, killing at least 37 people and injuring 76,
officials said.
   The airline said the crash was caused by engine failure and ruled
out sabotage.
   The British Midland Airways Boeing 737-400 was en route from
London's Heathrow Airport to Northern Ireland when it developed
engine trouble, the Civil Aviation Authority said.
   The jet attempted to land at East Midlands Airport near
Nottingham, about 100 miles north of London, but undershot the
runway by a half-mile and crashed alongside a highway, smashed into
an embankment and broke apart, police said.
   Witnesses reported seeing an engine in flames as the aircraft
came in low, dropping bits of debris and shearing off treetops as it
careened toward the highway. Cars swerved to avoid the hulk and
there were a few minor injuries from auto collisions, police said.
   ``We believe that 37 people have died as a result of this
accident, but there are still some people in the wreckage,''
Leicestershire Assistant Chief Constable Tony Butler told a news
conference.
   He said he did not know whether the trapped people were dead or
alive. It was also not certain that all 37 were aboard the plane,
since police reported there may have been casualties in cars on the
highway.
   After nearly eight hours of rescue efforts at the edge of
England's busiest north-south highway, one of the people aboard was
still trapped alive in the wreckage and two bodies awaited recovery,
the Leicestershire Ambulance Service said.
   Police in the county of Derbyshire reported several bodies
scattered on each side of the highway. Two nearby hospitals reported
a total of 76 people injured.
   ``All of them seemed to have smashed ankles and legs, and with a
lot, their faces were badly damaged too,'' said Joe Weston-Webb, 50,
who lives in the nearby village of Sutton Bonningale and was among
the first on the scene. He helped rescue several people and saw many
bodies in the wreckage.
   ``It seems a miracle that any one got out alive though, and I
can't believe that it all didn't go up in flames. It was
horrendous.''
   The plane, a new aircraft that only had been in service for three
months, was carrying 118 passengers and eight crew, the airline said.
   The crash was the second major air tragedy in Britain in three
weeks. On Dec. 21, a Pan Am Boeing 747 bound for New York blew up
over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on
the ground. That jet had also left Heathrow. A bomb was blamed for
the crash.
   The flight Sunday took off from Heathrow Airport at 7:52 p.m. and
its engine caught fire 10 minutes later, the Department of Transport
said.
   The pilot told the control tower he had the engine fire under
control, but when the plane was still one to two miles out, ``it was
clear that there would be an accident,'' airport official Michael
Cowan told a news conference.
   `As the plane approached the control tower it was apparent it was
too low,'' he said.
   Airline executive Colin Roberts told relatives at Belfast
Airport, ``There was absolutely no question of sabotage and there
was nothing to indicate that whatsoever.''
   The accident was caused by a technical fault in one of the
engines of the new plane, which had made seven flights on the
London-Belfast route, he said. The weather was reported good.
   The 737 crashed at about 8:30 p.m. (3:30 p.m. EST) about a mile
outside the village of Kegworth, Inspector Neville Cotterill of the
Leicestershire police said.
   The tail section as embedded in the ground and the fuselage broke
into several parts spread over fields, Cotterill told The Associated
Press.
   But he added that no cars were known to have been hit as the
plane thundered alongside the M1, England's main north-south highway.
   The highway was closed as dozens of ambulances and fire engines
converged on the scene. Cries for help could be heard from inside
the fuselage. Personal belongings littered the highway.
   Rescuers dug steps into the embankment and formed a human chain
from the wreckage to the ambulances. They flattened trees and hacked
open the fuselage.
   The cockpit with a large chunk of fuselage came to rest in thick
brambles and trees near the top of the embankment.
   The pilot, Capt. Kevin Hunt, was hospitalized with multiple
injuries, British Midland said.
   A local vicar, the Rev. Michael Brandon, said he held a
passenger's hand and whispered the Lord's Prayer to him as he died.
   ``It was very dignified and peaceful. There is not a lot more you
can do in a situation like this,'' he said.
   The crippled jet roared over 16-year-old Samantha Phelby's house
just before it hit the ground.
   ``We looked outside as it got louder and as it was going overhead
we saw the left engine still on fire. Then we heard this pop, which
could have been the crash. Then we heard the fire engines,'' she
told Independent Radio News.
   Desmond Anderson, who lives 400 yards from the airport's main
runway, said, `The far side engine was on fire, backfiring and
roaring away ...
   An Automobile Association manager, John McKnight, said: ``There
are still people trapped and work is going on to free them. From the
reports I have had there is a terrific amount of wreckage. It's a
hell of a mess.''
   British Midland chairman Michael Bishop said said the pilot
reported ``severe vibrations in one of the engines'' and asked
clearance for an emergency landing at the airport.
   Bishop said the company had taken delivery of the plane only 12
weeks ago.
   Civil Aviation Authority spokeswoman Ann Noonan said the pilot
reported problems in his No. 2 engine and was having trouble
climbing. The two-engined aircraft disappeared off ground control
radar screens at 8:15 p.m.
   The Boeing 737-400 is a version of the Boeing 737 with a longer
fuselage and can carry 146 passengers. It was introduced last year.

<TEXT>
   Political parties are struggling to emerge in
this British colony but face the formidable hurdles of apathy,
public distrust and a wary Communist China, which gains sovereignty
over the territory in 1997.
   Attempts to form the groups comes as Britain prepares to hold
Hong Kong's first general legislative elections and China appears to
have reluctantly dropped its opposition to such activity.
   The organizations will be different from Western-style political
parties because they will not be able to form a sovereign
government. Instead, they will be limited to trying to influence the
outgoing British rulers and pursuing whatever local power Beijing
permits under the ``high degree of autonomy'' it promises for this
capitalist enclave after 1997.
   ``The administration of Hong Kong will be in the hands of Hong
Kong people, so in that sense we still have a lot of power,'' said
Yeung Sum, chairman of Meeting Point, a pressure group of about 300
members that views itself as a future party.
   In recent weeks, businessman Stephen Cheong and lawyer Martin
Lee, both members of the colony's Legislative Council, have
announced plans to form political parties. Councilor Maria Tam's
Progressive Hong Kong Society also is mentioned as an emerging party.
   Those groups are expected to participate in general elections to
be held in 1991 for 10 of 56 seats on the council, which is
primarily a forum to debate policy made by the British governor and
his advisers. The council now consists of government officials,
government appointees and representatives of interest groups and
local advisory boards.
   The 1991 elections ``will be run on party lines, I'm quite
sure,'' said Joseph Y.S. Cheng, a political scientist at the Chinese
University of Hong Kong. But the groups will face huge problems in
gathering support from Hong Kong's 5.7 million people, who
traditionally distrust political parties.
   Families who fled to the coastal enclave blame China's myriad
20th century woes on both the Communists and Nationalists, who moved
to Taiwan after the 1949 revolution. Both parties operate
unofficially in Hong Kong.
   ``People in Hong Kong feel very comfortable with the status quo,
and they are afraid of political activities, political
confrontation,'' Cheng said.
   Yeung acknowledged that Meeting Point had not clearly declared
itself a political party for so long because ``all through the
years, people (have been) skeptical of the label.'' Cheong rejects
the ``party'' label for his new group.
   Political scientist Peter Harris of the University of Hong Kong
believes the groups will have trouble winning broad backing. He said
``the mass of the Hong Kong people are more interested ... in
getting the kids to school. Their understanding of issues is still
in a very inchoate stage.''
   Attempts by civic leaders three years ago to form political
parties stalled not from apathy but because of China's opposition,
according to Lee.
   That stance appears to have softened, however, with the onset of
legislative elections that China has promised will continue after
1997.
   Xu Jiatun, China's main representative in Hong Kong, said early
this month that the new constitution being drafted for the territory
effectively allows political parties.
   Many of the emerging political groups have not clearly stated an
ideology and may be identified primarily by the personality of their
leaders. Some of those leaders may seek to become Hong Kong's first
chief executive, which will be the top local post after the British
leave.
   Cheong said his group will call for stability and only gradual
political change, while Lee is the territory's most vocal advocate
of sweeping democratic reform. Three-year-old Meeting Point's goals
include a high degree of self administration for the territory after
1997, a central social security fund and more education subsidies,
Yeung said.
   Lee believes the major issue dividing the parties will be whether
they speak primarily for Beijing or Hong Kong interests.
   One big question is whether the Chinese Communist Party in Hong
Kong, which now works behind the scenes, will go above ground to
openly participate in elections.
   ``That would frighten the industrialists away, immediately,''
said Lee.
   Despite the growing activity of local political groups, Harris
sees little hope for them to wield real power, noting that
authoritarian Communist countries such as China do not accept
challenges to their rule.

   An earthquake with a preliminary reading of 5.1 on
the Richter scale shook a small island south of Tokyo today, the
Central Meteorological Agency said. There were no immediate reports
of damage or injuries.
   The tremor, which occurred at 12:15 p.m. (10:15 p.m. EST Sunday),
was centered at about 12 miles under the seabed south of Miyake
Island, about 100 miles south of Tokyo, the agency said.
   It said another undersea earthquake of lesser magnitude hit the
same area 36 minutes earlier. No magnitude was available for the
first quake.
   The island is home to 4,300 people.
   The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its
epicenter, according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale is considered ``very
strong,'' a reading of 6 means ``severe,'' and capable of widespread
damage near the epicenter.

   They were lukewarm about the Declaration
of Independence and the Constitution. They opposed the War of 1812.
And in presidential elections they voted against their neighbor,
John Kennedy, and their governor, Michael Dukakis.
   The people of this Cape Cod community have never gone with the
flow and they show no signs of changing as they celebrate
Barnstable's 350th anniversary this year.
   ``I hate to use the cliche Yankee independence, but I suspect
there is an aspect of that,'' said Patricia Duffy, who has been
helping compile a lengthy history of the town for use in the school
curriculum. ``We are cautious. We don't jump on any bandwagons.''
   Barnstable lives in the shadow of its neighbors Hyannis and
Hyannisport, made famous by the Kennedy clan.
   But Hyannis and Hyannisport are not officially incorporated as
towns; they are merely two of seven villages in the town of
Barnstable, which occupies the midsection of the cape.
   Barnstable is the principal municipality of Barnstable County,
which encompasses all of Cape Cod. It's the state's third largest
community geographically and has a year-round population of about
35,000 that doubles during summer.
   But few outside New England know its name, although residents
hope to change that with a 12-month celebration that promises much
variety, if little peace and quiet.
   Festivities include a summer rowing regatta, a colonial costume
day, a publishing party for the Cape Cod Almanac, and a Boston Pops
concert on the Hyannis town green.
   The big celebration comes in early September, the actual
anniversary month, and includes a visit by a delegation from
Barnstable's namesake, Barnstable, England.
   The events the town will commemorate began in September 1639,
when Barnstable was incorporated under a land grant from the Plimoth
Colony.
   The town history describes reaction to the American Revolution as
mixed, with wealthy Tories quarreling with patriots over British
domination. John Crocker, whose ancestors were among the town's
first 45 inhabitants, puts it in physical terms: ``In the Crocker
Tavern (still standing) there is a gouge out of one of the beams
where a couple of fellows had a sword fight over the issue.''
   The town neither endorsed nor opposed the Declaration of
Independence. A town meeting initially voted against the U.S.
Constitution because it lacked a bill of rights.
   ``The people were more wealthy down here and they were tending
toward the status quo,'' said Robert O'Leary, a social studies
teacher.
   Early thriving industries included cranberry harvesting, which
survives to this day, shipbuilding, lumbering, oystering and
extraction of salt from the ocean. Today tourism dominates.
   Because of the importance of sea trade to Barnstable, the
townspeople opposed the War of 1812 against Britain. This time there
was no give to their position: Isaiah L. Green, the area's U.S.
representative, voted for the declaration of war and lost his seat,
according to the school department history.
   Residents remember the Kennedy era fondly. They speak of John F.
Kennedy parading through town after his Democratic presidential
nomination, and of his victory speech in Hyannis after the 1960
election.
   But at the polls, residents favored Richard Nixon by 4,515 to
2,783. They had no greater favorite-son feelings last year, when
George Bush beat Dukakis 10,026 to 9,971.
   Joseph Kennedy brought his family to Hyannisport in 1926 but it
wasn't until his son became a national figure that the sandy beaches
and sunshine of Cape Cod gained national attention and later
unrestrained development, say local historians.
   ``The beauty, uniqueness and excitement of the cape portrayed by
the press put Barnstable on the map and in the world spotlight,''
according to the school department narrative.
   Cape Codders regret some of the growth, as they showed last fall
when they supported a non-binding resolution in favor of a building
moratorium. Former U.S. Sen. Paul Tsongas, a Cape Cod summer
resident, said the problems on Cape Cod are as much aesthetic as
environmental.
   ``Much of what has been built on Route 28 in Hyannis is
schlock,'' Tsongas said. ``If the development that took place was
architecturally consistent with the cape, it would not have been
half as offensive as it is.''

   The increase follows a nearly a one-third drop from 1983 to 1987.
   Schools responding to the annual survey, to be published today by
the trade magazine Nursingworld Journal, had a total of 15,494
freshmen in 1988, up from 13,970 in 1987.
   ``Probably the most important thing is that there has been so
much publicity about the national shortage of nurses,'' Publisher
Richard A. DeVito, said Friday.
   But a more troubling factor, DeVito said, is that many schools
have reduced entry level grade point averages to attract more
applicants. Perhaps as a result, he said, graduate nurses failed
their licensing exams at a record rate of 16 percent in 1988, four
times the 1987 level.
   The journal said it sent its survey to 1,491 U.S. nursing schools
and received responses from 227 institutions in 44 states.
   Hospital officials hailed the finding as good news for the
nation's health care system, which has been strained by a
``significant and persistent shortage'' of nurses, according to a
December report by the Commission on Nursing of the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services.
   About 300,000 nursing jobs were unfilled nationwide, the American
Nurses Association estimated last year.
   DeVito said the shortage has had a direct impact on wages,
pushing up starting salaries for registered nurses by an average of
$5,000 to $6,000 during the last five years. Registered nurses now
typically start at $22,000 to $28,000 a year, depending on region,
and experienced nurses earn up to $55,000 in some cities, he said.
   According to the survey, licensed practical nursing programs
experienced the greatest increase in beginning students in 1988,
with a 25.4 percent jump. Hospital-based diploma programs were next,
with a 14.6 percent rise.
   Baccalaureate programs at four-year colleges and universities saw
a 10.7 percent increase. The smallest change was in associate degree
programs offered by two-year junior colleges, which reported 8.7
percent more freshmen.
   DeVito cautioned that because of the decline in entrance
requirements, the overall increase of 11 percent may not necessarily
translate into an 11 percent rise in the number of graduates.
   ``The problem it's going to create is that while we have roughly
a big increase in freshman enrollees, they've lowered the admission
standards, so we may have fewer people who are going to be able to
make the grade,'' he said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This Media General-Associated Press poll is based
on telephone interviews Nov. 10-20 with 1,084 adults in the
continental United States. The phone numbers were selected randomly
by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the
most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult
American were asked the same questions the results theoretically
would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19 of 20 times. The
error margin is larger for subgroups _ 4 points for women, for
example, and 5 for Democrats.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. In your opinion, how serious a problem is homelessness in the
United States? Is it very serious, fairly serious, not too serious,
or not serious at all? Very: 68 percent. Fairly: 24. Not too: 5. Not
at all: 1. Don't Know or No Answer: 2.
   2. Do you think the problem of homelessness is getting worse,
improving, or staying about the same? Worse: 68. Improving: 3. Same:
24. DK-NA: 5.
   3. Who do you think should be primarily responsible for helping
homeless people _ the federal government, state government, local
government or private charities? Federal: 32. State: 24. Local: 18.
Charity: 9. DK-NA: 17.
   4. Do you think federal spending on helping the homeless should
be increased, decreased or remain the same? Increased: 60.
Decreased: 6. Same: 27. DK-NA: 7.
   a. (If increased) Would you be willing to pay more taxes for
that? Yes: 86. No: 11. DK-NA: 3.
   5. Thinking about why most people are homeless, would you say
society is mainly at fault, or the homeless personally are mainly at
fault? Society: 45. Homeless: 33. DK-NA: 22.
   6. Do you think homelessness is a problem only in big cities, or
in communities of all sizes? Cities: 24. All sizes: 74. DK-NA: 2.
   7. Does the federal government do enough to prevent people from
becoming homeless, or not? Yes: 27. No: 58. DK-NA: 15.
   8. Should the federal government build more subsidized housing
for poor people? Yes: 65. No: 27. DK-NA: 8.
   9. How about people who are homeless _ should the federal
government spend more to provide them with housing? Yes: 62. No: 27.
DK-NA: 10.
   10. Should people be allowed to live on the streets if they want
to? Yes: 45. No: 51. DK-NA: 4.
   11. Are there homeless people in your community? Yes: 59. No: 37.
DK-NA: 4.

<HEAD>Attorney General Says Administration Did Not Try To Thwart Walsh
Inquiry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the
Reagan administration did not try to thwart independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh from pursuing his investigation of the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Thornburgh said Sunday that Walsh had assured him before dropping
two key charges against Oliver North that he had been dealt with
``in good faith'' and had gotten ``full cooperation from the
intelligence community.''
   Thornburgh's comments on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley'' came after questions of whether he realized his
administration's decision to withhold some classified evidence on
national security grounds would force the prosecutor to drop some
charges against the fired National Security Council aide.
   The attorney general said he himself was concerned about any
impression ``there was some kind of cover-up or stonewalling of the
independent counsel's office.''
   In a meeting Wednesday, the day before Walsh moved to drop the
charges, Thornburgh said he asked for Walsh's personal assurance
``that he had been able to follow every line of inquiry that was
available, that he had had full cooperation from the intelligence
community, and that ... everyone he dealt with had acted in good
faith.''
   Walsh ``had no hesitation in satisfying my concerns on that
score,'' said Thornburgh. Walsh has not commented publicly on the
matter.
   Thornburgh said it was ``inherent'' that if the documents were
withheld, it ``would have an eroding effect on the quality of the
government's case'' against North. But ``the decision was Judge
Walsh's.''
   Thornburgh said that apart from revealing national security
secrets, a criminal trial on the original charges probably would not
have revealed anything ``that would surprise anybody'' in light of
the Tower Commission report and congressional investigation of the
Iran-Contra affair.
   North is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 31 on a dozen remaining
felony counts, including obstruction of congressional and
presidential inquiries, false statements to Congress and improperly
converting travelers checks belonging to the Nicaraguan Contras to
his own use.

   Americans generally agree that homelessness is
widespread and worsening, and most are dissatisfied with the
government's response and would be willing to pay more taxes to
combat the problem, a poll has found.
   A plurality of the 1,084 adults surveyed in the Media
General-Associated Press poll primarily faulted society rather than
the homeless for homelessness.
   A plurality also said the federal government is chiefly
responsible for solutions.
   The poll exhibited the broad reach of homelessness: Six in 10
said homeless people were in their communities, and three-quarters
said the problem plagues communities of all sizes, not just big
cities.
   Accordingly, respondents rated the problem as extraordinarily
severe. Sixty-eight percent called it ``very serious'' and 24
percent said ``fairly serious.'' The remainder gave it less
importance.
   The national poll, conducted by telephone among a random sample
of adults Nov. 10-20, had a 3-point margin of error. It was
completed before winter's cold increased attention on the homeless.
   Still, nearly seven in 10 respondents said homelessness was
getting worse, a quarter said it was unchanged, and 3 percent saw
improvement. The remainder had no opinion.
   Views were divided on the responsibility for solutions.
Thirty-two percent said the federal government was primarily
responsible; 24 percent said state governments, 18 percent said
local governments and 9 percent said private charities. The rest had
no answer.
   Wherever prime responsibility lies, only 27 percent said the
federal government was doing enough to prevent people from becoming
homeless, and 58 percent said it was not. The remaining 15 percent
had no opinion.
   A solid 60 percent said federal spending on programs for the
homeless should be increased, and 86 percent of that group said they
would be willing to pay higher taxes for that purpose. That totaled
52 percent overall, an unusually high level of acquiescence to
higher taxes.
   On specific programs, 62 percent said the federal government
should spend more on housing for the homeless, and as many favored
the preventive measure of building more federally subsidized housing
for the poor.
   In virtually all these measures, homelessness was seen as severe
and worsening by a greater share of women, Democrats, liberals,
minorities and younger people. They also were more apt to blame
society and to favor a greater federal response.
   Seventy-eight percent of women rated the problem as ``very
serious,'' compared with 56 percent of men, for example.
Eighty-three percent of Democrats said it was getting worse,
compared with 54 percent of Republicans. And sixty-four percent of
liberals said society was at fault, compared with 37 percent of
conservatives.
   An economic division also existed among respondents, with lower
income Americans more likely to view the problem as serious and to
favor greater responses. Of those with family incomes less than
$25,000 a year, for instance, 73 percent favored more subsidized
housing, but among those earning more than $50,000 just 54 percent
agreed.
   The survey found split views on the issue of people living on the
streets by choice. Of those with an opinion, 45 percent said people
should be allowed to live on the streets if they want to, but 51
percent said they should not have that right.
   Finally, the survey asked who was mainly at fault for
homelessness _ society or the homeless themselves. Forty-five
percent said society was primarily to blame; 33 percent said the
homeless and 22 percent had no answer.

<HEAD>It's Income vs. Spending As Legislatures Convene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA BARNAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Aid to education, prison overcrowding, insurance reform, property
tax relief and the environment are among the issues challenging
state lawmakers this year, but none looms as large as the battle of
the budget.
   It's income vs. spending, and if revenues are up, so are costs of
services. Just to stay even is more expensive, without talking about
adding money for things like schools, road repair or social services.
   ``What we face in the coming months will not be easy,''
Connecticut Gov. William A. O'Neill said last week in his
state-of-the-state address. ``We will have to say `No' when we
really want to say `Yes.'''
   Some states, including Alaska, California, Connecticut, Iowa,
Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana, New York and West Virginia, are
running in the red or face deficits in the coming fiscal year.
Others, like Illinois, have avoided deficits by no-frills budgets
and face a backlash from the lean years.
   A lucky few are running surpluses, heating up debate on what to
do with the largesse.
   Caution abounds. New York and Massachusetts saw surpluses of a
few years ago turn to deficits _ at least $636 million in
Massachusetts' current $11.6 billion budget and more than $1 billion
in New York's budget of more than $28 billion.
   States expecting to do well this year _ Hawaii, Kansas,
Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, Idaho and Maryland _ are
fearful of the same thing happening to them.
   ``It's real easy to make a tax cut right now, and we all look
good for re-election,'' says Hawaii House Finance Committee Chairman
Joseph Souki. ``But is that the wisest thing?''
   Lawmakers, having read voters' lips, are loath to talk about
hiking taxes. The idea is being mentioned mainly in the states with
the biggest money woes, and the most likely candidates are increased
taxes on cigarettes, alcohol and gasoline, rather than raising state
income taxes.
   Spending on education has perhaps the highest priority. Even in
West Virginia, with a fiscal headache totaling $680 million,
Gov.-elect Gaston Caperton has promised unspecified raises to the
state's teachers, who rank 46th nationally in salaries. Illinois
education officials, who have gone two years without a significant
budget increase, are expected to seek increases totaling more than
$600 million this year.
   Coupled with increasing aid to education is the need in some
states to restructure the system for public school financing to
reduce the disparities between rich and poor districts. Montana's
Legislature must fashion a new system to replace one that a state
court last year declared unconstitutional.
   Prisons are another big-ticket item. Michigan is in the middle of
a massive prison building program; by 1991, the state will have
spent $900 million to build 28 prisons, and if projections hold
true, the system still will be overcrowded.
   ``The cost of operating prisons is eating us alive,'' said
Michigan Senate Appropriations Chairman Harry Gast.
   Virginia is building two new prisons to increase its inmate
capacity by 2,600, but corrections officials say the state still
will be at least 1,000 beds short in a few years and more money will
be sought.
   ``The cost of crime is expensive, so we must accept the fact that
the money drawn to support the criminal justice system is money that
we will not have for the wide range of other important needs
throughout the commonwealth,'' said Gov. Gerald L. Baliles.
   Once lawmakers have their budget priorities settled, they still
won't lack for issues.
   Rising auto insurance costs are expected to be debated in New
Jersey, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. And California is awaiting
the results of a court challenge to Proposition 103, a voter
initiative passed last November that requires a 20 percent rate
rollback for most kinds of insurance and tougher state regulation of
insurers.
   The environment and waste disposal is another sore spot for some
states. New Jersey suffered a second consecutive summer of beach
closings because of high bacteria levels and medical waste washing
ashore, and the Legislature passed a series of measures designed to
help clean up the state's ocean waters.
   However, other proposals to track the disposal of medical waste,
impose tougher penalties on polluters and create a powerful
commission to protect the coast remain mired in disputes.
   South Carolina residents are clamoring for reductions in the
amount of hazardous waste buried in a landfill used by more than 30
other states, and the Legislature is studying ways to deal with
rapidly filling solid-waste landfills, also a consideration in New
Hampshire.

   A second Japanese old soldier has hanged himself
after leaving a note that he wished to follow Emperor Hirohito in
death, police said today.
   A passer-by found the body of Yohichi Terunuma, 76, hanging from
a tree on a local shrine's grounds Sunday afternoon, said Akira Iida
of the police department in Katsuta, about 60 miles northeast of
Tokyo.
   Iida said a note found in Terunuma's jacket pocket read in part:
``Allow me to follow the generalissimo ... as a solider.''
   Emperor Hirohito, once considered a living god and the supreme
figure in Japan's armed forces, died Saturday of intestinal cancer
at age 87. After World War II, the emperor renounced his divine
status and a new constitution defined his role as symbol of the
nation.
   Terunuma had served as an ensign in the former Japanese Imperial
Navy during World War II.
   On Saturday, an 87-year-old man who once served with the Japanese
Imperial Army hanged himself in a shed near his home in Wakayama,
280 miles southwest of Tokyo. He also left a note saying he wanted
to follow the emperor in death, police said.
   In Japan's feudal days, there were cases in which samurai
warriors killed themselves, following their lords in death. In the
best known case in modern history, Gen. Maresuke Nogi and his wife
committed suicide on the day of Emperor Meiji's funeral in 1912.

   A flock of ducks that waddle
through yards and dirty the streets has prompted a neighborhood
civil war of sorts in which both sides are crying foul about the
other's tactics.
   The domesticated Muscovy duck population has swelled to 200,
prompting some to begin efforts to reduce their numbers. The methods
have included egg stealing, trapping, maiming, and ducks being run
down by motorists.
   ``The ducks got caught in a people problem,'' says Jim
Vanairsdale, a pro-duck member of a committee named by the City
Commission to try to resolve the yearlong dispute. ``It's sad what
has happened.''
   Those in favor of the ducks claim the animals were in the
Woodland neighborhood when the middle- to upper-class area was
established more than 20 years ago. Opponents say the birds are too
aggressive, leave droppings underfoot and mate in public.
   Many in this oceanside city of 3,200 people agreed the duck
population should be reduced, and the dispute has been focused on
how many ducks would be allowed. For some people, one Muscovy is one
duck too many.
   A duck trapper was hired to relocate the ducks to Georgia, but
there were questions about the humaneness of his trapping methods.
   The St. Augustine Humane Society helped catch others, but they
relocated them too close, enabling some to return.
   The ducks are such an emotional issue here that they dominated
three monthly meetings of the St. Augustine Beach City Commission.
One meeting erupted into name-calling before Commissioner Pete
Dodson suggested last summer that a committee find a solution.
   ``I agreed to act as a moderator. Two people from each side were
appointed to act as a committee,'' he said.
   ``We've got to live together and stop this monkey business.''
   At the committee's first meeting, Dodson asked each member to
tell him how many ducks should be allowed.
   The numbers began at zero, with the average being 17, which
became the standard.
   Then Bill Van Marter, a former city commissioner who had
supported ridding the neighborhood of Muscovy ducks, complained in
August that his wife and granddaughter were attacked by a rogue
drake in their back yard.
   Mrs. Van Marter, who declined to be interviewed, told officials
at the time that she was forced to fling the bird, ``as big as a
turkey,'' into a nearby palm tree to stop the attack.
   After the attack, the committee voted to reduce the Muscovy
population to nine adult birds, where it stands.
   Efforts also were started to filch eggs from nests.
   But when reports surfaced that motorists were purposely running
down the ducks and that ducks were being maimed by having their legs
hacked off, the dispute intensified.
   Kathryne Grove, who witnessed one of the ducks being run down,
said: ``I was sick at my stomach. Why would anyone have to murder
them or run them down?''
   During a recent 30-minute tour of the 80-home area, only six
ducks were spotted, including one getting a douse from a hose
wielded by a woman trying to get it off her property.
   The Florida Aubudon Society has little good to say about the
Muscovy ducks, a domesticated version of the wild ones in Mexico and
South America.
   ``These things are a cancer. They are not supposed to be here,''
said Wes Biggs, state coordinator of the society's Florida Breeding
Bird Atlas Project.
   ``They are a real nuisance and we would be better off without
them,'' he said, adding that ``little old lady bunny huggers''
compound the problem by feeding them and treating them as pets.
   But now that the duck population has been lowered, Dodson
believes the situation will improve.
   ``I'm very optimistic the problem will be solved,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pro-Democracy Leader Released From Shanghai Jail</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China today released a 33-year-old dissident who
was active in the pro-democracy movement in Shanghai and whose case
was taken up by the U.S. Congress.
   Yang Wei, a former student at the University of Arizona, walked
from Ti Lan Qiao Prison in Shanghai today after serving one year of
a two-year sentence.
   Fu Fenghao, an official at the Shanghai Foreign Affairs office,
said because Yang spent about a year in custody before being
sentenced, he was let out on time.
   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, Yang said his
first concern upon release was the health of his father, who has
cancer.
   ``I'm going to see him today,'' said Yang. ``He is in the
hospital and he is in serious condition.''
   Yang was sentenced in December 1987 for ``demagogical propoganda
for counterrevolutionary ends.''
   He had been held without charges since January 1987 in connection
with pro-democracy student demonstrations in Shanghai in 1986.
   Yang said he did not regret marching for democracy and writing
for ``China Spring,'' the banned periodical of the Chinese Alliance
for Democracy, a New York-based dissident group. But he said he was
unclear whether he would continue working for political change in
China.
   ``I just got out,'' he said, ``so I don't really understand
what's happening in society. When I determine that then I will make
a decision.''
   Yang described his treatment in prison as ``pretty good.''
   ``It seemed that I was given special treatment,'' he said.
   Yang, who received a master's degree in molecular biology from
Arizona, said he wanted to return to the United States to continue
his studies.
   Sources close to the family said Yang's release was delayed by
several hours today because three members of the Chinese Alliance
for Democracy were apprehended in Shanghai over the weekend with
copies of ``China Spring'' and a letter for Yang.
   The alliance was set up in 1983 by a former Chinese citizen to
promote democracy in China. Chinese officials have declared it an
illegal, reactionary organization.
   Two of the men _ Huang Han of Canada and Bell M.S. Wong, an
American who also goes by the name Huang Wencheng _ were ordered out
of China and flew to Hong Kong, the official China Daily said today.
   The third man, Tang Guangzhong, flew back to the United States to
continue studies at Utah State University.
   The report said the three acknowledged they were members of the
alliance. It also said they had admitted breaking the law.
   It was not clear why Tang, a Chinese citizen, was allowed to
return to the United States.
   During Yang's trial in 1987, the court said he put up
``reactionary slogans'' at Shanghai's Fudan University on Dec. 22,
1986 and sent letters to students in Canton and Beijing inciting
them to protest.
   Hundreds of thousands of students marched in dozens of cities
during the winter of 1986-87, calling for democracy.
   On Dec. 3, 1987, the U.S. Congress passed an amendment to a State
Department appropriations bill calling for Yang's release, saying he
had broken no Chinese or U.S. laws.
   China called the amendment ``an undisguised interference in
China's internal affairs.''
   Yang's wife, Che Shaoli, lives in Houston and studies
microbiology at the Baylor College of Medicine.
   She said she was thrilled at the news of his release.
   ``But I am sad, too,'' she said. ``I don't know when I will see
him.''

<HEAD>Briton Freed From Iranian Jail Speaks of Experiences</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 23-year-old Briton freed after more than two
years in a Tehran jail claims he was trying to join Afghan
guerrillas when Iranian border guards seized him on the
Iran-Pakistan frontier.
   The Mail on Sunday quoted Nicholas Nicola, who arrived back in
Britain on Dec. 27 after his release, as saying he had been kept
mostly in solitary confinement except for a weekly shower and
interrogation.
   He also confirmed reports that he had been tried, although
because the trial was held in the Farsi language, said he had been
unaware he was serving a 3{-year sentence for possessing weapons,
the newspaper reported.
   Nicola bought a ticket to Pakistan in 1986 in order to join the
Afghan rebels fighting the Soviet-backed Communist government, the
Mail said.
   ``My thoughts were to go and find the mujahedeen (Moslem
guerrillas) ... so I could fight against the Russians,'' the weekly
paper quoted him as saying. Soviets troops have backed Afghanistan's
communist government against the guerrillas in a decade-old conflict.
   Dressed in Afghan clothes and carrying a rifle and pistol he had
bought at a market, Nicola told the paper he was in Pakistan on the
border with Iran when an Iranian patrol began running toward him.
   ``I think they saw my guns,'' he was quoted as saying.
   ``One fired two shots and, without thinking, I fired two shots
into the air with the rifle,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The Iranians beat Nicola, screamed at him and then took him to
prison, he said. After his trial, he remained at Tehran's maximum
security Evin Prison, the report said.
   Nicola said he wasn't sure what to do with his life now, the
paper reported.
   ``I have been too naive,'' he was quoted as saying. ``I had
romantic ideas from the movies. I know it isn't like that now.''
   His release was the latest sign of a thaw in relations between
the countries since they virtually cut diplomatic ties in 1987 after
a dispute which began when British police arrested an Iranian envoy
on shoplifting charges.
   Roger Cooper, a British businessman who has lived in Iran for
more than 20 years, has been jailed there without trial for more
than three years on charges of spying.

   He describes himself as an extremist, a
perfectionist, a man who likes to shock people, and a man who never
wears the same dress twice.
   When he slips into a black organza evening gown, he doesn't
consider it simply cross-dressing but a craft and a challenge:
``Take it the whole distance or not at all.''
   But Gene, who asked that his last name be withheld, does not
change his voice.
   ``I am not trying to pass myself off as a woman. I want them to
know I am a man. I want them to see the art in what I am doing,'' he
said in an interview published Sunday in The Times-Picayune.
   For Gene, 32, this time of high fashion and late-night,
last-minute fittings got its first audience Sunday night at the
Municipal Auditorium, as he was the master of ceremonies at the
Krewe of Polyphemus' annual gay ball.
   On Feb. 7, Mardi Gras, the season will conclude with the Bourbon
Street Awards, which Gene has been master of ceremonies for the past
six years. Only once did he yield to suggestions that he do the show
as plain old Gene: He wore a fez and his performance suffered.
   Only once did his job as a clothing store manager require him to
miss Mardi Gras.
   ``It almost killed me,'' he said.
   Last year, drawing inspiration from Cher, he donned a black body
stocking that left only small, beaded bits of the anatomy to the
viewer's imagination.
   This year, even less will be more _ a trend that could drive him
into retirement.
   ``I feel a tremendous amount of pressure. I can keep coming up
with costumes, but I can't take off any more clothes than I've
already taken off,'' he said.
   ``How many more ways can I show skin and still be creative?''

   This normally quiet central Pennsylvania
community of about 7,700 has issued a rather loud eviction notice to
unwanted crows.
   After five days last week of trying to shoo the birds with loud
noise, officials said the number of crow sightings in town markedly
decreased.
   About 35,000 crows were estimated to be in the area at sundown
Friday as a propane gas-fired cannon was being set up to scare them.
The birds soon flew away.
   Police concluded the effort against the birds Saturday morning by
firing off several noisemakers to chase the few crows that had
returned.
   Various kinds of fireworks had been set off since Tuesday to
convince the birds that trees in Milton are unacceptable places for
them to roost at night.
   It remains to be seen whether the crows will return, so residents
have continued their noisemaking to ensure that their unwanted
visitors stay away.
   Resident Vida Switzer, for instance, bangs a wooden spoon against
a cast-iron frying pan, and Thomas Deans claps his hands when he
walks to and from work.

   Byron Pursifull says he's never seen a tree
he didn't like.
   And the 61-year-old building and maintenance supervisor for the
Johnson County Parks and Recreation Department intends to leave his
mark on the county in the form of greenery.
   The founder of the Johnson County Garden Club, Pursifull has
taught schoolchildren to plant crab apple trees and has designed
landscaping and planted trees in the Johnson County Park.
   Pursifull's devotion to tree planting has earned him the
attention of the National Arbor Day Foundation, which plans to honor
him April 29.
   He is one of two people who will receive the Lawrence Enerson
Award, named after a former trustee of the Arbor Day Foundation. The
award honors those whose life work exemplifies commitment to tree
planting and conservation as part of community improvement.
   ``When he's talking, they (children) listen to him and you can
tell in their eyes how interested they are in what he has to say,''
said Don G. Wertz, science coordinator at Custer Baker Middle School
in Franklin, who nominated Pursifull for the award. ``When he talks
about trees, he refers to them as `little fellows.' He's such a nice
gentleman to have around kids.''
   Pursifull's current project: planting trees at the Johnson County
Park to honor anyone who is a county resident.
   ``I sincerely hope future generations will be able to stroll
around this site while they think of loved ones honored with a
living tree,'' he said.

<HEAD>Stocks Dollar, Rise In Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices surged on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
today in the first day of trading after Emperor Hirohito's death,
and the dollar edged higher against the Japanese yen for the third
consecutive session.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected shares, a 25.75-point
gainer Friday, shot up 468.85 points, or 1.5 percent, closing at
30,678.39 points, a record high. The previous record was 30,243.66
last Wednesday.
   It was the largest one-day advance since Jan. 6, 1988.
   Saturday's half-day session of stock trading was canceled after
Emperor Hirohito died of cancer early in the day.
   A dealer at Nomura Securities said small investors were drawn
back into the market after the emperor's death.
   ``During his three-month-long illness, many individual investors
were extremely cautious and anxious about what might happen when the
emperor died,'' said Michio Katsumata. ``But that's over now.''
   Katsumata added that January is traditionally a bullish month for
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and that investors also were responding to
positive economic conditions in Japan.
   Buying interest gradually spread to institutional investors as
prices kept drifting higher through the day, other traders said.
   Dealers said shares were bought on expectations of higher prices
ahead. Many economists have predicted Japan's economy will continue
to boom until the middle of this year, due partly to continuing
domestic demand.
   ``As much as it is discouraged by the death of Hirohito, the
market has high hopes for the beginning of a new era,'' said Koji
Kamemura, head of Yasuda Mutual Insurance Co.'s fund management
division.
   Kamemura said the yen's stability in Tokyo also is providing the
market with more reason for bullish sentiment.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 126.08 yen,
0.11 yen higher than Friday's close of 125.97 yen. It opened at
126.05 yen and traded between 125.85 yen and 126.23 yen.
   The dollar now has gained 2.03 yen in three trading sessions.
   Trading was described as restrained. Some foreign exchange
dealers had anticipated the yen would dip to as low as 129 yen to
the dollar after Hirohito's death.
   An estimated $5.5 billion were exchanged in spot trading today.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Break Off Talks with Soviet Union</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Afghan guerrilla leaders refused today
to resume direct talks with the Soviets, accusing Moscow of playing
political games aimed at securing its communist proteges in Kabul a
place in a post-war government.
   The guerrillas promised not to attack departing Red Army troops
but said their decision to break off negotiations means fighting is
likely to continue after Feb. 15, when the 50,000 Soviet troops
remaining in Afghanistan are to withdraw under a U.N.-brokered
accord.
   The Pakistan-based guerrilla leaders ended talks with Soviet
Deputy Foreign Minsiter Yuli Vorontsov on Saturday, deadlocked over
the composition of a post-war government but saying they were ready
to meet again.
   But Vorontsov later told reporters that Moscow would find a way
to support its Marxist allies in Kabul if a broad-based government
that includes communists is not in place Feb. 15.
   Moslem insurgents, who have been fighting the Soviet-backed
communist regime in Kabul for a decade, have unanimously rejected
the participation of any of its members in a post-war government.
   Today, the spokesman for the U.S.-backed insurgents, Sibghatullah
Mojaddidi told a news conference:
   ``Because the Soviets use threats, look for war rather than
peace, and disrespect Afghans' right of self-determination, we
believe that negotiations are unproductive and unnecessary.
   ``The Soviets have threatened that if their terms are not
accepted they will supply new weapons, not deployed before, to
(Afghan President) Najib's regime after the withdrawal,'' said
Mojaddidi. ``The Soviets' efforts to impose a government of their
choice on the Afghan nation will protract the war and kill our
people.''
   Although Mojaddidi ruled out the cease-fire sought by Vorontsov
but promised that Moslem guerrillas, called mujahedeen or Islamic
holy warriors, would not attack departing Soviet soldiers.
   He said Vorontsov was told ``we can only order mujahedeen not to
attack your withdrawing troops. We can give you peace . . . to
pass.''
   The Soviet envoy has said Moscow will meet the February
withdrawal deadline unless departing Soviet soldiers are attacked by
guerrillas.
   ``It could be delayed if there were all out fighting on Soviet
forces, if there were attacks on Soviet forces withdrawing,''
Vorontsov said earlier.
   More than 100,000 Red Army troops moved into Afghanistan in
December 1979 and replaced one pro-Moscow regime with another. In
April, the Kremlin agreed to withdraw its forces by Feb.. Half had
left by August.
   Vorontsov has been on a diplomatic mission since early December,
seeking a political consensus on a broad-based government to step
into the breach following the withdrawal.
   He has met with the Iran- and Pakistan-based guerrilla groups,
which both agree that Najib's ruling party can play no part in a
post-war government. About 3 million Afghan refugees live in
Pakistan, another 2 million in Iran.
   Modaddidi said the decision to break off the talks means fighting
is likely to continue beyond Feb. 15.
   He predicted that the guerrillas' allies, most notably the United
States and Pakistan, will continue their support after the Red Army
leaves and predicted that the current Kabul government will collapse
within months of the final Soviet pullout.
   The Pakistan-based guerrilla alliance, the dominant insurgent
force, has said it plans to form a council that would, at the
collapse of Najib's government, choose a transitional government
from within its ranks.
   Both Pakistan- and Iran-based guerrillas would nominate council
members.

   Residents of three states today struggled
to recover from tornadoes that destroyed a third of the buildings in
this southeastern Illinois town and injured more than four dozen
people.
   ``It looks like this place has been bombed,'' Mayor Jack Loeffler
said Sunday from an emergency command post in a bank.
   Twisters hit the Illinois towns of Mill Shoals, Albion and
Allendale on Saturday afternoon before moving into Indiana and
touching down near Vincennes. Late Saturday, a tornado cut a
two-mile path through the southern Kentucky community of Franklin.
   Fifty people were injured in Illinois, and 22 remained
hospitalized Sunday. The three people injured in Indiana were
released from hospitals by Sunday; no injuries were reported in
Kentucky.
   ``After seeing everything that's happened, we were pretty lucky
no folks were hurt,'' said Simpson County Judge-Executive Ken Harper
in Kentucky.
   The National Guard was sent to the tornado-ravaged areas of
Illinois and Kentucky to help with the cleanup and to prevent
looting.
   Loeffler said the tornado cut through a 10-square-block area of
Allendale, destroying 53 homes and nine businesses, as well as the
post office, fire station, city hall and a school.
   On Sunday, the National Guard and other emergency workers cleared
trees and power lines that had been knocked down and other rubble
from streets, but hadn't made much headway on houses, said Gen.
Donald Lynn.
   Police said people whose homes were destroyed were staying with
friends or relatives in town, and about a dozen were taken to
shelters.
   Shocked officials and residents of this town of 600 assessed the
damage Sunday.
   ``It's a mess is all you can say,'' said Allendale resident Linda
Griesemer. ``Houses are flattened, windows blowed out, roofs gone.''
   A damage estimate was not yet available, Loeffler said.
   Gov. James R. Thompson toured Allendale and flew over the other
affected areas. He said he planned to declare Allendale a state
disaster area.
   ``It's a mess. It's awful,'' Thompson said. The tornado ``not
only took out a third of the homes, it took out almost the entire
downtown and all the public facilities.''
   In Mill Shoals, two or three mobile homes were overturned and a
few homes and farm buildings were damaged. In Albion, five buildings
were damaged but there were no injuries, said Mayor Earl Bailey.
   In Indiana, a twister came within a mile of Vincennes Lincoln
High School, where 2,500 people were watching a junior varsity
basketball game when the storm knocked the school's power out.
   ``People are moving back into their homes and salvaging what they
can,'' Sheriff's Deputy Jerry Reitmeyer said Sunday. ``We were lucky
last night. It didn't rain anymore after the tornado, so not a lot
of homes were water-soaked.
   ``One or two homes are really damaged extensively enough that the
people won't be able to live in them.''
   Five homes were destroyed and 25 were damaged by the tornado that
hit Franklin, Ky.
   ``It came and went so quickly that some people slept through it,
didn't know it had happened,'' Harper said.
   William Huff said he went to his front door to investigate the
booming sounds of the tornado.
   ``I opened the front door, and the next thing I know, the house
was gone,'' Huff said. His two-bedroom house was leveled.

   David O. Dodd took his secrets to the
grave after he was hanged at age 17 for being a Confederate spy 125
years ago.
   A coded message detailing Union positions around Little Rock
after the city fell to Union troops in September 1863 was found in
his boot.
   But Dodd refused to answer questions or testify at a
court-martial.
   Dodd was convicted of spying for the Confederacy and hanged Jan.
8, 1864.
   On Sunday, Civil War enthusiasts gathered at Dodd's plot in Mount
Holly Cemetery to mark the 125th anniversary of his execution. About
40 people _ half in Civil War dress _ stood in the cold as William
W. O'Donnell of Little Rock, author of articles about Dodd,
proclaimed him the ``Boy Martyr of the Confederacy.''
   ``It's a story of unbounded courage,'' O'Donnell said.
   A crowd of 6,000, some of whom walked across the frozen Arkansas
River, witnessed Dodd's hanging near downtown Little Rock. The
execution took five minutes, and wasn't over until a Union soldier
climbed the gallows to jerk the rope, O'Donnell said.
   ``Dodd was one of the youngest ever executed as a spy,'' said
Jerry Russell, a member of the Civil War Roundtable of Arkansas.
   Dodd's fate began to unravel in late December 1863. He traveled
south from Little Rock, surrendering his pass to get through a Union
roadblock. After spending the night with a relative, Dodd headed
back toward the occupied city.
   ``The Union lines had moved out a couple of miles the next day.
Since Dodd had surrendered his pass, he couldn't get through,''
Russell said.
   ``There wasn't a real tight ring of steel around the town. He
might have gotten through with his information. If Dodd had really
been the sneaky type, he would have gone through the woods.
Apparently, he was not sneakily inclined, and thought he could go
through the roadblock.''
   The offer to betray his allies was extended to Dodd by Gen.
Frederick Steele, who, ``in his written reports, felt really bad
about it. He was very anguished over this thing, but they could not
condone spying,'' Russell said.
   Dodd also wouldn't tell why he was carrying the message, which
was in Morse code. ``Why did he do it? Why? He never told anybody,''
O'Donnell said. ``He never took the stand in his own defense. How
could a 17-year-old have so much courage to face the gallows without
trying to escape?''
   In a letter to his family on the day he died, Dodd wrote, ``I was
arrested as a Spy and tried, and Sentenced to be hung today at 3
o'clock. The time is fast approaching but thank God I am prepared to
die. I expect to meet you all in heaven. Do not weep for me for I
will be better off in heaven.''
   On Sunday, the Lord's Prayer and a 21-gun salute echoed in the
windswept cemetery. Seconds passed between each of the three volleys
as seven riflemen reloaded their black-powder weapons.
   Anthony Rushing, 26, of West Memphis, who wore a gray Civil War
coat in the ceremony's color guard, said his image of Dodd comes as
much from the heart as from the history books.
   ``He was done an injustice. I think they were trying to make an
example of him. He was a hero,'' Rushing said.

   It was confession time for NBC Entertainment
President Brandon Tartikoff as he put his hand on a stack of Bibles
carried by an actor dressed as a priest.
   Yes, Tartikoff confessed, it probably was a bad idea to broadcast
Geraldo Rivera's special on Satanism, which was picked up by the
entertainment division after news side refused to touch it with a
10-foot pitch fork.
   ``I would not say it was our finest hour,'' Tartikoff told a
gathering of newspaper writers and critics Saturday after staging
the stunt with the Bibles, at which he also vowed not to buy a
sequel to Vanna White's ``Goddess of Love.''
   Tartikoff said specials like November's ``Devil Worship: Exposing
Satan's Underground,'' which featured gruesome reports of torture,
child sexual abuse and baby skinning, are best left to the world of
syndication.
   ``I don't think you'll be seeing more programs like than from
NBC,'' he said.
   Tartikoff said the network didn't know far enough in advance that
Rivera's material would be so graphic.
   ``He did not come in saying, `I've got something you're going to
love _ skinning babies,''' Tartikoff said.
   NBC President and Chief Executive Robert Wright, however, said he
remains unrepentant about the Satanism special.
   Wright echoed Rivera's own defense of the program, calling the
topic ``exciting and newsworthy.''

   Emperor Akihito today set the tone for his reign by
pledging to work for peace and preserve Japanese democracy, but said
he faced ``awesome responsibilities'' after the death of his father,
Hirohito.
   The four-minute speech was Akihito's first public statement since
he ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne when Hirohito died of cancer
Saturday at age 87. It was delivered at the Imperial Palace during a
simple ceremony attended by Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and 237
other dignitaries.
   Outside, hundreds of thousand of Japanese streamed past to pay
their respects to Hirohito, who reigned for 62 years.
   ``Shrouded in sorrow and overwhelmed by the awesome
responsibilities I undertake, I stand humble before you,'' said
Akihito, who was clad in a black cutaway and gray trousers.
   ``I pledge myself to continue in the spirit of his late majesty,
making his desire to constantly be at one with the people my desire
as well, joining together with you to preserve the constitution of
Japan, and thereby execute my duties faithfully,'' he added.
   Japan's post-war constitution, which bans the emperor from any
role in government and limits him to ceremonial functions, formed
the basis for the country's democracy. It limits the emperor's role
to signing bills into law and serving as ``symbol of the state and
the unity of the people.''
   ``I do fervently desire the further development of Japan, peace
on Earth and enhanced well-being for all peoples,'' Akihito said.
   He spoke clearly and solemnly, with the new Empress Michiko, 54,
on his left wearing a black dress and veil and their son, Crown
Prince Naruhito, 28, on his right.
   By Japanese tradition, Akihito's statement was his first Imperial
Rescript, in which a new emperor sets a tone for his reign.
   The rite, in the palace's main ceremonial hall, was an important
milestone in the transition to Akihito's new imperial era of Heisei,
or ``Achieving Peace.''
   On Sunday, Hirohito's body was wrapped in a white cloth and
placed in a coffin made of Japanese cypress at the palace in
preparation for the Feb. 24 burial. Representatives of more than 130
countries, including up to 50 heads of state or government, are
expected to attend.
   Hirohito's era, called Showa, or ``Enlightened Peace,'' ended
with his death, and according to Japanese tradition he becomes known
as Emperor Showa. His reign stretched from Japan's descent into
militarism and defeat in World War II to its impressive recovery
into an economic superpower.
   Thousands of police were deployed today to prevent violence by
radical leftist and rightist groups, for whom the emperor embodies
Japanese militarism and nationalism.
   Hirohito was revered as a living god until he was forced to
renounce his divinity at the end of World War II, and Japanese
soldiers fought and died during the war in the monarch's name.
   Two old soldiers have hanged themselves since learning of
Hirohito's passing, saying in suicide notes that they wanted to
follow the emperor in death. An 87-year-old former army man hanged
himself Saturday, and the body of a former navy officer was found
Sunday hanging from a tree in a temple compound.
   Mourners continued to stream to the palace today to sign
condolence registers outside the main gate. On Sunday, the palace
said 438,376 people braved drizzling rain to honor the late emperor
at the palace, and the number of signers today had reached 223,020
by 3:30 p.m.
   Japan's stock market today boomed to a record high closing and
its biggest gain in a year in the first session since Hirohito's
death.
   A dealer at Nomura Securities said small investors were drawn
back into the market after the emperor's death.
   ``During his three-month-long illness, many individual investors
were extremely cautious and anxious about what might happen when the
emperor died,'' said Michio Katsumata. ``But that's over now.''

   ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' a film
adapted from Milan Kundera's novel, was voted the 1988's best
picture by the National Society of Film Critics.
   The film, about a Czech surgeon who flees his homeland when the
Soviets invade in 1968, mixes politics and eroticism. Its director,
Philip Kaufman, was honored Sunday by the society with the best
director award.
   Other winners were:
   Actor: Michael Keaton, ``Beetlejuice'' and ``Clean and Sober.''
   Actress: Judy Davis, ``High Tide.''
   Supporting Actor: Dean Stockwell, ``Married to the Mob'' and
``Tucker.''
   Supporting Actress: Mercedes Ruehl, ``Married to the Mob.''
   Documentary: ``The Thin Blue Line,'' by Errol Morris.
   Screenplay: Ron Shelton, ``Bull Durham.''
   Cinematography: Henri Alekan, ``Wings of Desire.''
   The society voted a special award to Pedro Almodovar, director of
``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'' and ``Matador,'' ``for
his originality.''
   The society, made up of 39 critics from major publications, has
given awards for 23 years. It held its annual meeting Sunday at the
Algonquin Hotel.

   A man says he didn't pay much attention to
the bones his dog had been bringing home for the past two months
until the animal retrieved a human skull.
   The dog brought home the skull Saturday afternoon, and
authorities are treating the case as a homicide, said police
spokesman Mark Mann.
   Mann said efforts to recover the body and find clues were
hampered by snow, rain, low temperatures, and damage to the
scattered remains by dogs.
   The bones found near a city water pumphouse in northeast Tacoma
Saturday and Sunday have limited value in solving the case, police
said.
   But the skull had lots of dental work, which may help in
identifying the victim.
   Mary DeTracy, medical investigator with the Pierce County Medical
Examiner's Office, said the victim could be identified by Wednesday,
after the teeth are compared with dental records of missing persons
filed with the state patrol.
   Jim Farrell said his dog, Duke, began bringing home bones about
two months ago.
   He said he tossed most of bones in a nearby gully until Saturday
afternoon, when Duke brought home the skull.
   Most of the bones were found Sunday morning behind the pumphouse,
about 100 yards from Farrell's home, Mann said.

<HEAD>Broadway's ``42nd Street'' Closes After Eight Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dancing feet of the cast of ``42nd Street''
took to the stage one last time, as the second longest-running show
on Broadway closed after eight years and 3,486 performances seen by
10 million people.
   Based on the 1933 Warner Bros. movie starring Ruby Keeler, Dick
Powell and Ginger Rogers, the show told the tale of a chorus girl
replacing an aging star who breaks her ankle just before opening
night.
   It closed on Sunday but it may be revived in April with an
all-black cast, and the scenery and other equipment is being kept.
   Its music includes such classics as ``Lullaby of Broadway,''
``Shuffle Off to Buffalo,'' and the title song.
   The musical's longevity was second only to ``A Chorus Line,''
which opened in 1975.
   ``42nd Street'' won the 1981 Tony Award for best musical, and its
director and choreographer, Gower Champion, won a posthumous Tony
for choreography.
   Champion died just hours before the opening-night performance in
New York on Aug. 25, 1980. He was 59 and had a rare form of blood
cancer.
   Few involved in putting on the musical had known of Champion's
illness, and the cast and audience were not informed of his death
until after the final curtain, when producer David Merrick announced
it from the stage.
   Merrick, now 77, suffered a stroke six years ago that makes it
difficult for him to speak.
   ``It's been a wonderful opportunity to have brought this
extravaganza to Broadway and I take pride in the fact that it has
been seen by 10 million people,'' Merrick said through his attorney.
   Merrick watched the final show from the audience and he posted a
letter backstage to thank the cast and crews for ``your brilliant
talents, your dedication, your boundless energies and caring, and
your total professionalism.''
   He has produced more than 80 Broadway shows, including ``Hello,
Dolly'' and ``Play It Again, Sam.''
   ``42nd Street'' opened with a cast of 54 that included Tammy
Grimes, Jerry Orbach, Wanda Richert and Lee Roy Reams. It closed
Sunday starring Elizabeth Allen, Jamie Ross, Jim Walton and Clare
Leach.
   Thirteen cast members had been in the show since opening night.
There have been six marriages within the company and six babies born.
   The musical played at three theaters: the Winter Garden, the
Majestic and the St. James, where its final performance was played.

   A Pan Am jumbo jet made an emergency landing this
morning at Heathrow Airport after the pilot reported problems with
its hydraulic landing gear, officials said. There were no reports of
injuries.
   Fire engines and ambulances lined the runway as the Boeing 747,
carrying about 200 people from Washington, D.C. to London, landed
safely shortly after 7 a.m. (2 a.m. EST).
   ``He radioed ahead and the airport was put on alert,'' said an
airport spokeswoman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom. ``In any event, it landed without significant problems.''
   The plane's flight number was not given.

<TEXT>
   The 12-week-old jetliner that crashed in England
was the first involving a Boeing 737-400, a model introduced last
year, a Boeing Co. spokesman said.
   The British Midland Airways jet, carrying 126 people, crashed
Sunday while attempting an emergency landing about 10 minutes after
leaving London's Heathrow Airport en routeto Belfast. Authorities
said at least 37 people were killed.
   Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said the aircraft was purchased last
fall by GPA Leasing in Shannon, Ireland, which leased it to British
Midland. He said it is the first accident involving a 737-400 or a
737-300, which is 10 feet shorter than the 400 series.
   The 737-400 was certified by the Federal Aviation Administration
in September and 17 of the $28 million to $32 million jets are in
use, Gamble said Sunday.
   British Midland chairman Michael Bishop said the company had
taken delivery of the twin-engine plane only 12 weeks ago. He said
the plane reported severe vibrations in one of the engines about
eight minutes into the flight. Witnesses said one of the engines was
on fire as it attempted to land at an airport about 100 miles north
of London.
   Gamble said the engine used on both 737 models is the CFM-56,
which is built in France by a consortium made up of General Electric
and SMECMA, a French concern.
   He said the engines are brought to the United States and
reassembled and tested at a General Electric plant near Cincinnati.
The completed engines are shipped to the Boeing plant at Renton, a
suburb of Seattle, where the 737 is manufactured.
   The CFM-56 has been the world's top-selling commercial jet engine
during the past two years surpassing GE's rival, Pratt &amp; Whitney
Aircraft, in the market for powering standard-body jets of
short-to-medium-range routes.
   More than 5,900 of the engines have been sold to more than 100
operators since the engine entered service in 1982.
   Dwight E. Weber, a spokesman for CFM International and the GE
aircraft engine business group, declined to speculate on the role
the CFM-56 may have played in Sunday's crash.
   ``We'll be working with the airline to determine the cause,''
Weber said Sunday. ``Once the cause is determined, if it's
engine-related, we'll be working with the customers who operate the
engine to determine if it's an isolated case or a fleetwide
program.''
   A Boeing team was to travel to England today aboard a 737-300
that was being delivered to British Midland, said David Jimenez,
another Boeing spokesman.
   The 737-400 was rolled out in January 1988, and the first flight
was in March. Depending on the interior design, the jet can seat 130
to 150 passengers.

   Assailants hurled two grenades into a
crowd attending award ceremonies at a basketball tournament, killing
at least 13 people and injuring 78 in the southern Philippines, the
military said today.
   Lt. Anselmo Cabingan, a military spokesman, said authorities had
no indication of who was responsible for Sunday night's attack at a
basketball court in Esperanza, a remote town about 600 miles south
of Manila.
   About 1,000 people, many of them children, were attending the
tournament when the attack ocurred, said Sgt. Joven Astrero of the
operations section of the Philippine Constabulary in Cotabato City,
about 40 miles from Esperanza, which is in Sultan Kudarat province.
   Astrero said the tournament had just ended and the town's mayor,
Romulo Latog Sr., was awarding trophies when the blasts occurred.
Latog and his son, Romulo Jr., were among the injured, he said.
   The government-run Philippines News Agency agency, quoting a
local radio station, put the death toll at 26 people, mostly
children.
   Astrero said there were conflicting reports on the casualty
figure but it appeared the agency count was too high. Astrero could
not confirm how many children were killed.

   A U.S. soldier was slightly injured
today when a group of protesters hurled firebombs at an American
military base in the southern city of Taegu, police and U.S.
authorities said.
   A U.S. military spokesman said the attackers hurled seven
firebombs at Camp Henry in the city 180 miles south of Seoul.
   The American soldier was hurt when a firebomb was hurled through
the windshield of the jeep he was driving, the spokesman said. The
firebomb did not explode, but the soldier was cut by flying glass,
he said.
   U.S. authorities said they did not know why the base was
attacked, but the camp and other American bases in South Korea have
been attacked in recent months by radical students demanding the
withdrawal of U.S. troops.
   Police said today's attack involved five or six youths who
identified themselves as ``patriotic students in Taegu'' in the
leaflets they scattered. Police reported no arrest.
   Police said the leaflets contained criticism of last Wednesday's
downing by U.S. warplanes of two Libyan fighters over the
Mediterranean Sea.
   It was the second attack on Camp Henry in a month. Radical
students chanting anti-U.S. slognas firebombed the camp on Dec. 27,
cauing a small fire at a building. The fire was quickly extinguished
with no injuries.
   Dissidents and radical students have staged anti-American
protests demanding the withdrawl of some 42,000 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact against
communist North Korea. They contend U.S. forces in the country help
perpetuate division of the Korean peninsula.
   Korea was split into the communist north and the capitalist south
in 1945, when U.S. and Soviet troops ended Japan's colonial rule
over the peninsula.

<HEAD>Winter Weather Gives South A Chill; Michigan Bridge Closed</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Moist Gulf of Mexico air in tandem with cold air produced a
potpourri of sleet, freezing rain and snow today from the lower
Mississippi Valley across the Tennessee Valley to the central
Appalachians.
   In Michigan, snow combined with winds up to 60 mph Sunday to
reduce visibility on the Mackinac Bridge and forced the Mackinac
Bridge Authority to close the structure to traffic for an hour,
authority spokeswoman Lorraine Garries said.
   ``We didn't get much accumulation, it was just blowing,'' Garries
said, adding it was only the third time in 11 years that the bridge
was forced to shut down because of weather.
   Snowfall totals across Michigan's upper peninsula ranged up to 13
inches, but the lower peninsula had snowfall totaling 1 to 4 inches.
   Wet snow fell in parts of Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi and
Alabama.
   It also settled over the central and southern Appalachians where
2 to 3 inches of snow accumulated. Up to 6 inches of snow was
expected in southern West Virginia, with 8 inches over higher
elevations.
   Winter weather also affected the Northwest today, with snow
falling over eastern parts of the Pacific Northwest, Montana and
Idaho. Between 6 and 12 inches of new snow was expected in parts of
Idaho by tonight.
   Meanwhile, rain fell along the central Pacific coast.
   Strong winds were blowing across the Rockies' east slopes in
Wyoming and Montana. Winds gusted to 60 mph in the upper Yellowstone
River Valley in Montana.
   Much of the nation's midsection was in the grip of a frigid
arctic air mass, with temperatures plummeting below the zero mark in
much of the northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley.
   The frigid air was flowing eastward across the warmer waters of
the lower Great Lakes, creating lake effect snow east of Lake
Ontario and Lake Erie.
   The high Sunday was 86 degrees at Fort Myers, Fla.
   Today's forecast called for rain along much of the Pacific coast
and extending from the western and central Gulf Coast to Tennessee
and North Carolina; snow across the northern Plateau into the
northern Rocky Mountains, and in the mid-Atlantic Coast and the
southern Appalachians; scattered snow showers in the Great Lakes
region; fair to partly sunny skies across the rest of the nation.
   Predicted highs: below freezing from the northern and central
Rockies through the lower and middle Mississippi Valley to New
England; single digits and teens from eastern Montana through
Minnesota and Iowa to the upper Great Lakes; 50 degrees-plus from
the southern and central coast of California through the Rio Grande
Valley of Texas to the southern Atlantic coast, with lower 60s in
Southern California, and 70s and lower 80s in Florida.
   The nation's temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 27 degrees
below zero at Devils Lake, N.D., to 73 at Miami and Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.

<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in Europe this morning, supported
by expectations of higher U.S. interest rates. Gold prices fell.
   Traders said expectations that U.S. interest rates were poised to
rise were fueling the dollar's recent rally, but fears that central
banks may intervene were keeping a lid on the U.S. currency, at
least for the time being.
   Demand was generated mostly by speculative institutional
investors, while corporate clients appeared reluctant to commit
themselves to the dollar's recent advance, traders said.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7670, compared with
$1.7797 Friday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday:
   _1.8265 West German marks, up from 1.8140
   _1.5575 Swiss francs, up from 1.5475
   _6.2265 French francs, up from 6.1830
   _2.0595 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0480
   _1,339.00 Italian lire, up from 1,330.50
   _1.1965 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1912
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.11 yen to a closing 126.08 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 126.55 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $406.40 a troy ounce, up
from $405.75 bid late Friday. But at midmorning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a lower recommended price of
$404.45.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $404.80, down from $405.50 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.97 to close at a bid $407.18.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.97 a troy ounce,
unchanged from Friday's late price.

   Foreign Minister R.F. Botha of South Africa rose to
give a speech today at an international conference on chemical
weapons and most delegates walked out in protest of his country's
apartheid policies.
   Botha then proposed an African conference on poverty.
   ``Chemical weapons are one way to die. Thirst and hunger is
another,'' he told the delegates who remained in the nearly empty
hall. They included the U.S. contingent.
   Before the speech, Foreign Minister Robert Ouko of Kenya rose and
declared:
   ``The regime in this hall does not represent the people of South
Africa. Africa will leave the hall when the clique rises to speak.''
   Most all African delegations and numerous other Soviet bloc,
Asian and Latin American delegates then cleared the hall. Only 20 of
the 150 delegations remained.
   In addition to an African meeting on poverty, Botha proposed a
conference to declare Africa a chemical weapon-free zone and to
resist Western efforts to dump toxic wastes on the continent.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no say in
national affairs and have separate schools, neighborhoods and
medical facilities. The government is controlled by the country's 5
million whites.

<TEXT>
   With the Super Bowl less than two weeks away,
brokers are busy selling ticket packages for as much as $20,000 for
the football extravaganza.
   That's the going price for an air-conditioned skybox seating nine
at the 75,000-seat Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami where the Super Bowl
will be played Jan. 22.
   ``It's like an apartment,'' said Raquel Barouh, who is fielding
inquiries for the $20,000 skybox offering. ``It's worth the price.''
   The National Football League doles out Super Bowl tickets to the
league's 28 teams, with the most going to the competing teams and
the host city. The teams decide how to distribute their allotment.
   The NFL forbids the sale of tickets for a premium, and scalping
is illegal in Florida, noted James Steeg, NFL special events
coordinator.
   That makes individual ticket sellers reluctant to talk about
their offerings, but brokers who package the tickets with hotel
stays, buffets and transportation aren't so shy.
   ``We're offering $500 a seat,'' said Jerry Adelman of Murray's
Tickets in Los Angeles, where there are no restrictions on ticket
resales. ``We'll probably handle up to 3,500 seats.''
   The agency is offering a three-day package for $1,025, but
Adelman says, ``I'd rather go to Hawaii myself.''
   The Cincinnati Bengals and the San Francisco 49ers won decisive
conference championships Sunday to advance to the Super Bowl and a
shot at the NFL title.
   The Bengals, who lost the Super Bowl in 1982 to the 49ers,
defeated Buffalo 21-10 to win the American Football Conference. The
49ers beat the Chicago Bears 28-3 for the National Football
Conference title.
   Larry Reader, a salesman who lives near Indianapolis, bought 10
tickets for customers, paying $500 for six seats in the end zone and
$850 apiece for four seats on the 25-yard line.
   Wendy Lester of Miami wrote in a classified ad appeal: ``Help my
brother and I get to our first Super Bowl.''
   She ended up spending $1,000 on two tickets.
   ``It seems the things you want to do get more expensive as you
get older,'' she said.
   For $15,000, a dentist is offering four end-zone Super Bowl
tickets, a week's stay at a country club condominium and a Cadillac
for transportation.
   Dr. Ron Marx of Hollywood hasn't gotten any takers yet on his
classified ad, but he's been getting plenty of inquiries.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' he said. ``These people will pay anything.
I've been getting calls from all over the country.''
   Marx is even willing to kick in a little extra.
   ``If people really push, I might even pick them up at the
airport,'' he said, adding he has received at least a dozen phone
calls and already has the proceeds spent.
   ``I figure I can put my kid through one year of Brown University
on this,'' Marx said.

   The neglect of today's children could
lead to deficiencies in tomorrow's work force, Lt. Gov. Marlene
Johnson of Minnesota warned participants in the second Women's
Agenda Conference.
   In the concluding session of the conference Sunday, participants
also were asked for a renewed commitment to maintaining legalized
abortion and the development of a national coalition.
   Johnson said a lack of adequate child care kept many parents from
participating in the economy.
   Ms. Johnson also said there was a need for women in leadership
positions and called on her listeners to work to develop leaders
from within their ranks.
   ``We need to keep fighting the battles,'' she said. ``But we also
need to keep nurturing each other to become stronger and more
effective in the larger community.''
   The conference, organized by the National Federation of Business
and Professional Women's Clubs, began Friday. It was sponsored by
more than 50 organizations nationwide.
   Dolly Adams of the Black Women's Agenda encouraged the
development of a national women's coalition. She said such a group
would need to have a larger vision than those of the individual
organizations involved.
   Other issues discussed Sunday included poverty among older women,
the need to bring divorced and widowed women into the work place,
and the possibility of a renewed campaign for an Equal Rights
Amendment.
   Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League, said that if abortion rights are abridged,
``1989 could be the year that women were put back in their place.''
   ``We are in danger right now of losing our vital right to decide
whether to have a child or not and under what circumstances,'' she
said.
   Ms. Michelman told the audience that the 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision by the Supreme Court occurred against the backdrop of the
women's movement.
   ``We instructed the court,'' she said. ``We became their
conscience. We created the context for Roe to happen.''
   Ms. Michelman urged the women to speak out and create a renewed
climate of activism for the pro-abortion movement.
   ``You have to go out of here absolutely committed,'' she said.
``I plead with you to be a part of millions of voices, silent no
longer.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze will
visit Beijing in early February to prepare for a China-Soviet
summit, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen of China said today.
   Qian is in Paris for an international conference on chemical
weapons.
   This year's planned summit between Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping would be the first in 30
years.
   Chinese and Soviet leaders last met in 1959 in Beijing when Mao
Tse-tung held talks with Soviet Communist Party chief Nikita
Khrushchev.
   Beijing and Moscow were close in the 1950s, but the two countries
split in 1960 over ideological differences and fought a brief border
war in 1969.
   Chinese national television said today that Shevardnadze and Qian
also will discuss Cambodia and other issues during their February
meeting.
   In December, Qian visited Moscow, the first time a Chinese
foreign minister had been to the Soviet capital in 30 years. The
trip appeared to be the first step toward normalizing relations
between the countries.

   Kids can sure make a mess. But admittedly,
4-year-old Ian Loizeaux made a bigger mess than most.
   One push of a button by the preschooler Sunday brought an
eight-story building in downtown Baltimore crashing down to ruin.
   Doug Loizeaux, 38, says he just wanted his son to try his hand at
the family business.
   Loizeaux is co-owner of Controlled Demolition Inc. The founder of
the business, his father Jack Loizeaux, also was on hand to see the
havoc wreaked by his grandson.
   The button that Ian had pushed set off 347 pounds of explosives
that had been carefully placed in 560 locations throughout the
building so that the building would topple safely.
   ``Absolutely perfect! I'm so proud of you. Everything moved just
right,'' said the elder Loizeaux, 73.
   The boy watched in silence as the Falconer Building, which housed
printing businesses for seven decades, vanished in an avalanche of
dust. Its place will be taken by an 11-story parking garage.
   Ian's uncle, J. Mark Loizeaux, president and co-owner of the
company, said he got his own start demolishing buildings at a young
age.
   ``I started at 8,'' he said. ``That was the only time we ever saw
our dad, by going to work with him.'' He and his brother Doug, who
have six children between them ranging, say they hope to see a third
generation take over the business.
   The work is ``instant gratification,'' Doug Loizeaux said. ``You
know if you're a hero or a bum in about eight seconds.''

<HEAD>Scotland Yard Offers Apology In Body Mix-Up, Father Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British investigator offered ``a
wholehearted apology'' for sending the wrong body to a family whose
daughter died aboard the Pan Am jet crash in Lockerbie, Scotland,
the young woman's father says.
   Robert Hunt said he met with a Scotland Yard official Sunday
afternoon at the Hunts' home in the Rochester suburb of Webster. His
20-year-old daughter, Karen, was among the 259 people killed aboard
Flight 103 when it exploded over Lockerbie last month.
   The British police official and an FBI agent spoke to the Hunts
after the Monroe County Medical Examiner's Office determined through
dental records and X-rays Saturday that the remains sent to the
family were not those of Karen Hunt.
   Ms. Hunt, a student at Syracuse University, would have celebrated
her 21st birthday Saturday.
   ``The British official just wanted to apologize,'' Hunt said.
``He offered a wholehearted apology and promised they were doing
everything possible to rectify the situation.''
   ``They really wouldn't commit to anything else,'' he said. ``I
got the feeling they don't want to tell us anything unless they're
100 percent sure.''
   He said he didn't know the name or title of the Scotland Yard
official.
   Gregory Jones, an FBI spokesman in Washington, confirmed that a
British police official met with Hunt, but said he had no details on
the misidentification. Jones said he didn't know what will be done
with the body sent to the Hunts.
   Officials in Washington ``have no idea'' where Ms. Hunt's body
is, Jones said.
   Karen Hunt was returning to New York after completing a
one-semester program in Syracuse University's Division of
International Programs Abroad in London. She was one of 35 such
students to die in the crash.

<DATELINE>KEGWORTH, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators today recovered the flight
recorders from the wreckage of a new Boeing 737 that crashed along a
highway after one engine, and possibly both, failed. At least 43
people were killed and 83 injured.
   Firefighters pumped foam onto the crumpled jet to prevent seeping
aviation fuel from catching fire. The Belfast-bound jet carrying 126
people broke into three pieces on the edge of Britain's main
north-south highway, the M1, in central England on Sunday night.
   The twin-engine Boeing 737-400 narrowly missed the small town of
Kegworth and plowed into an embankment just a few hundred yards
short of the runway as the pilot struggled to make an emergency
landing at East Midland Airport, 100 miles north of London.
   One engine was on fire, and Transport Secretary Paul Channon said
it ``certainly looks probable'' there was a problem with the second
engine.
   British Midland Airways said sabotage was not suspected in the
crash, which came less than three weeks after a bomb blew apart Pan
Am Flight 103 over a Scottish village, Lockerbie, killing all 259
people on board and 11 on the ground.
   Witnesses and a radio operator who monitored the pilot's final
exchanges with air traffic controllers Sunday also said both engines
appeared to have failed.
   British Midland said the jet was delivered just 12 weeks ago and
had flown less than 500 hours. It grounded its other 737-400 for
inspection.
   ``At the moment it does seem to be a technical problem,'' said
Paul Beaver, a managing editor of aviation for Jane's publications.
``I think they have ruled out pilot error and almost definitely
ruled out sabotage.''
   Beaver, interviewed on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,'' said
the chances of both engines failing were ``something like a 10
million to one chance, and of course sometimes those chances come
up.''
   At least four British soldiers serving in Northern Ireland were
among the 43 killed, police said.
   ``It's amazing'' no motorists or nearby residents were killed,
Leicestershire Assistant Chief Constable Tony Butler told a news
conference today. ``It's a very busy road.''
   Channon said the fast response of emergency services saved lives.
   ``The airport fire brigade was there within minutes ... a number
of people are living as a result.''
   Police said the last person was taken from the wreckage more than
seven hours after the crash. They said it took 2{ hours to extract
the pilot, Kevin Hunt. A spokeswoman for the Leicester Royal
Infirmary said Hunt was in poor condition with multiple injuries.
   The plane took off from London's Heathrow Airport at 7:52 p.m.,
and about eight minutes later reported ``severe vibrations in one of
the engines,'' said airline chairman Michael Bishop.
   The pilot reported an engine on fire, then said he had it under
control and asked for clearance to make an emergency landing at East
Midlands Airport, the airline's home base 100 miles north of London.
   Witnesses said the left engine was on fire as the plane crashed
about a half-mile shy of the runway. Ham radio operator Mervyn
Solloway said that from what he could hear, both engines were in
trouble.
   ``Suddenly there was, not a shouted message, but a bit of a
frantic one to say, `We've got problems with the other engine.' That
was the last I heard from the aircraft,'' he said.
   The aircraft sheared tree tops and plowed into a steep embankment
by the M1 highway outside the town of Kegworth. A piece of the jet
lodged in the highway divider and bodies and personal belongings
spilled from the plane.
   Motorists swerved in terror and some cars collided, police said.
The tail section embedded in the ground while the fuselage tore
apart, the nose section coming to rest in a bramble thicket.
   Dozens of fire engines, ambulances, residents and motorists
rushed to the scene. The engine fire was quickly extinguished, and
rescuers cut passengers loose. Surgeons performed amputations on the
spot.
   A local Episcopal vicar, the Rev. Michael Brandon, recited the
Lord's Prayer as a man died, clutching his hand.
   ``The whole plane is carnage,'' said Vic Milner, an Automobile
Association worker. ``People were strapped into their seats, dead in
the tangled body of the plane.''
   Several people in Kegworth, a town of 2,000 residents, said that
when the plane crashed, their first thought was of Lockerbie, the
little Scottish town that bore the brunt of the crash of Pan Am
Flight 103 on Dec. 21.
   All 259 people aboard that Boeing 747 were killed, along with 11
Lockerbie residents. Investigators said a bomb blew up the plane.
   In Sunday's crash, ``there nothing to indicate (sabotage)
whatsoever,'' said the airline's marketing director, Colin Roberts.
   David Learmount of the respected journal Flight International
said the British Midland plane must have developed ``more than just
a simple engine failure or the pilot could have gotten the plane
down safely.''
   He told British Broadcasting Corp. television said the Boeing
737-400 has ``the most brilliant safety record in the world today.''
   ``If an airplane's engine catches fire one of the reasons why is
that the engine, which has very fast spinning parts, literally
breaks apart and bits come out through the casing and this can cause
a fire,'' he said.
   In Seattle, Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said Sunday's crash was
the first involving a 737-400. The model had its first flight in
March and airlines are flying 17 of the jets, he said.

   Carrie Munson, a social worker who staged and
attended her own mock funeral 2{ months ago, has died of cancer of
the pancreas. She was 62.
   Munson had said she held the mock funeral, which drew nationwide
attention, to celebrate life and show that she did not fear death.
She died Sunday.
   The Rev. R.L. Lathan, who delivered the eulogy at the memorial
service in October, said two companies have been seeking the right
to publish the biography of Munson, who struggled to overcome heroin
addiction and became a social worker. An independent filmmaker is
also pursuing the rights to a movie about her life.
   ``She wanted to prove to the coming generation that the evils of
drugs could be defeated,'' Lathan said. ``That's what kept her so
fired up to fight it. She was real determined.''
   She had been diagnosed as having inoperable cancer of the
pancreas in October 1987.
   Munson said at the time of her mock funeral that she had been
addicted to drugs for years before turning her life around and
earning a degree from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1975.

<HEAD>Five Seeking Democrats' Chairman Job Meet With Southern Leaders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All five candidates for chairman of the Democratic
National Committee played to their Southern audience at a weekend
meeting, with the stress on luring moderate and conservative
Southern whites back to the party.
   The five candidates met about 100 committee members and party
activists Sunday.
   ``I don't want to run a party that writes off the South,'' said
Washington lawyer Ronald H. Brown, who has served in top party posts
and served as Jesse Jackson's 1988 convention manager. ``It doesn't
make sense. You can't do it that way.''
   Brown and Michigan party Chairman Richard N. Wiener, who is
president of the Association of State Democratic Chairs, are
considered favorites. But neither candidate has a majority of the
404-member DNC, and party leaders believe one of three dark horses
could win the Feb. 10 election.
   They are former Reps. Michael D. Barnes of Maryland, James R.
Jones of Oklahoma and James V. Stanton of Ohio.
   While many party chairmen in the West and Midwest have rallied
around Wiener, most Southern chairmen have remained uncommitted.
   Much of the talk Sunday concerned changing the public's
perception of the Democratic message. President-elect George Bush
swept the South in the November elections, just as most Republican
candidates have done for a generation.
   ``The perception is that we are to the left, are much more
liberal, than the mainstream voters,'' Jones said. ``Unless and
until we recognize that, unless and until we bring the party to a
position that is viewed as centrist and representing the vast
majority of this very diverse country, we're not going to win
elections.''
   Jones advocated a three-year advertising campaign that would
attempt to ``make it respectable to be a Democrat again.''
   Wiener said Republicans have put six hurdles in the path of
Democrats running for president: the issues of national defense,
patriotism, crime, gun control, school prayer and abortion.
   ``We don't have to be to the right of the Republicans on those
issues,'' he said. ``But we need to pass a certain threshold on
those issues.''
   He suggested imitating the GOP practice of spending heavily on
issues research, to identify Democratic strengths and Republican
weaknesses.
   Southerners remained uncommitted after the meeting.
   James Van Hecke Jr., the North Carolina party chairman, said the
Southern chairmen may hold a telephone conference later this week to
explore the possibility of a group endorsement.
   Several of the Southern party leaders in the audience said they
appreciated the lip service paid to regional concerns but heard few
specific solutions.
   ``Everybody has said to us for years that the South is the key,
and not one of these candidates disagreed,'' said Alan Diamonstein,
chairman of the DNC's Southern caucus. ``But you can't keep saying
that mathematically the South is the key while not saying how to do
anything about it.''

   Here is the text of the budget message which
President Reagan sent to Congress on Monday.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>To the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President
of the Senate:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Eight years ago many in this country were concerned about the
future of our economy, our government and, indeed, the nation itself.
   Unemployment was high and rising.
   Inflation and interest rates were reaching record levels.
   Our nation's defense capabilities had been weakened by neglect.
   The international prestige of the U.S. was at low ebb.
   To resolve the economic problems then facing us, our
administration proposed a recovery program centering on four
fundamental principles:
   _Reduce personal and business tax rates.
   _Reduce the rate of growth of federal spending.
   _Reduce the federal regulatory burden by eliminating unnecessary
restrictions while protecting the public's interest and safety.
   _Support a moderate and steady monetary policy to bring inflation
under control.
   To rebuild our defense capabilities and restore America's
standing in the world we proposed expanded national security and
international programs.
   We also initiated the largest management improvement program ever
attempted in order to restore the proper relationships among the
federal, state and local governments, and the private sector; to
eliminate waste in federal programs; and to introduce management
controls and efficiencies, while improving services.
   Today, the American people can be proud of the progress that has
been made on each of these fronts.
   As a result of this progress, America is internally stronger,
internationally more secure, and stands taller in the eyes of the
world than it did eight years ago.

<TEXT>
   Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem fighters
recaptured villages in south Lebanon today from pro-Iranian rivals.
Police reported ``horrific massacres'' and said at least 80 people
were killed in a 24-hour period.
   The Amal militia claimed its fighters had overrun four of five
villages seized Sunday by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of
God.
   But reporters who drove into the battle zone near Israel's
self-designated ``security zone'' on Lebanon's southern border said
Amal had retaken only three villages. Fierce fighting raged around
the other two.
   Police said at least 80 people had been killed and 200 wounded
since Sunday morning.
   A police spokesman in Sidon said many victims had been hacked to
death.
   ``Others had their throats cut and some were headless. Many were
riddled with bullets,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be named
under standing regulations. ``Horrific massacres have been
committed.''
   The casualties were the highest 24-hour toll since the power
struggle for Lebanon's 1 million Shiites, the country's largest
sect, flared in April. The latest round of battles began Dec. 31.
   Amal claimed its fighters recaptured four of the villages along
the main road from Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut, to Israel's
security zone on Lebanon's southern border.
   Reporters said Amal drove Hezbollah out of the battered villages
of Kfar Hatta, Kfar Melki and Kfar Beit in hand-to-hand fighting
from late Sunday to dawn Monday.
   Amal military commanders in Kfar Melki said about 1,000
militiamen and several Syrian-supplied T-54 tanks were attacking the
other two hamlets, Kfar Filla and Jbaa, where an estimated 500
Hezbollah fighters were holed up.
   Cars hit by rocket-propelled grenades smoldered in the streets of
Kfar Hatta and Kfar Melki, whose 8,000 inhabitants spent the night
hiding in apple and olive groves.
   Aisha Barhoum, 35, found her one-story house in Kfar Melki gutted
when she returned: ``They've burned my house, but God has burned
them in Amal's wrath.''
   As the fighting raged, she said: ``We've been liberated from
Hezbolshaitan.'' That's an Arabic pun on Hezbollah's name, meaning
``Party of Satan.''
   Amal and Hezbollah accused each other of ``atrocities and summary
executions'' in the fighting.
   Iran and Syria, Iran's main Arab ally in the 8-year Iran-Iraq
war, have been trying to rein in their feuding Lebanese proxies but
the fighting has raged despite appeals from President Ali Khamenei
of Iran and Syrian leader Hafez Assad.
   In Beirut, Syrian troops with rocket-propelled grenade launchers
patrolled two neighborhoods where Amal and Hezbollah clashed for two
hours Sunday.
   In April, Amal drove Hezbollah fighters from the south in a
four-day battle in which 62 people were killed and 150 wounded.
   Hezbollah retaliated in May, pushing Amal out of most of Beirut's
southern slums, a traditional Shiite stronghold, in a three-week
onslaught. Nearly 300 people were killed and 1,000 wounded.
   The fighting stopped when Syria, whose army controls security in
Moslem west Beirut, sent 4,500 troops into the slums.
   But the bloodletting broke out again in south Beirut in November
and spilled over into west Beirut. Forty people were killed and 87
wounded in six days of clashes.

   A would-be thief got more than he
bargained for when he trired to rob an elderly couple in a motel
room and was tackled by the man, then chased and captured by a crowd
of tourists, police said.
   Michael Lassiter, 33, of Daytona Beach was being held without
bond today in Volusia County Branch Jail on assault and robbery
charges following the Sunday morning incident.
   According to police, Lassiter entered the motel room of Howard
Douglas, 69, of Milwaukee and his wife, Evelyn, and demanded their
money.
   Douglas leaped out of the bathroom and tackled Lassister, police
said. Meanwhile, Mrs. Douglas yelled to a crowd at the pool deck.
She also took off her rings and threw them to a woman by the pool.
   Lassiter, who is 5-11 and 185 pounds, fled after a brief struggle
with Douglas.
   ``I was 5 feet 7 inches tall and 150 pounds, but when you get
near 70, I think you begin to shrink,'' Douglas said later. ``He
looked big when he was coming at me, but he looked a lot smaller
next to the police.''
   Lassiter reportedly headed toward the beach, with a crowd of
tourists _ including the Douglases' 38-year-old son, Craig _ in
pursuit.
   As Kempton Rothpletz, 24, of Dallas left his car to investigate
the commotion, Lassiter leaped into the vehicle and began to drive
off.
   But Lassiter's bad luck continued as Rothpletz jumped back into
the moving car and managed to force it into several parked cars.
Rothpletz suffered scrapes and bruises to his legs when they were
pinned by the car door, police said.
   Lassiter was captured by the group of tourists as he tried to run
away.
   He was charged with strongarm robbery, auto theft, aggravated
assault and burglary. A check showed that he also was wanted for
armed robbery and theft, police said.

<TEXT>
   Entering college freshmen are getting less aid
from the federal government and are increasingly interested in
making their educations pay off in cold cash, according to a survey
of more than 300,000 students.
   The annual survey nonetheless found that students entering
college in 1988 were more likely than their 1987 counterparts to
want to pursue graduate study despite the financial obstacles.
   And although students are more interested in making money, they
seem less interested in business careers as a means of reaching that
goal, the survey said.
   At the same time, a record proportion of freshmen reported
themselves feeling frequently depressed. Stress over paying for
college and attaining advanced degrees were possible contributing
factors.
   The findings released Sunday by the American Council on Education
and the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of
California at Los Angeles are based on questionnaires filled out by
308,007 freshmen entering 585 two-and four-year colleges and
universities. The results were adjusted to reflect the total
population of 1.64 million first-time, full-time entering students
and have a margin of error of plus or minus two points.
   Only 15.6 percent of freshmen entering school last fall received
Pell grants, the government's major aid program for low- and
middle-income students, the survey found. That was the lowest level
since the survey began 23 years ago and less than half the 31.5
percent who received Pell grants in 1980.
   Freshman participation in other federal aid programs also fell,
while students reported greater reliance on family contributions,
savings, loans and institutional grants.
   The amount of Pell grant aid awarded to students actually rose
nearly 57 percent from 1980 to 1988, or 17 percent taking inflation
into account, according to The College Board, a New York-based
lobbying group.
   But during the same period, the aid was more sharply aimed at the
very neediest post-secondary students, many of whom shun college in
favor of vocational schools that teach cosmetology, art, drama, auto
mechanics, business skills or other trades.
   Victoria Tripp, an Education Department spokeswoman, said 11
percent of Pell money went to vocational students in 1980, compared
with 27 percent in 1988. ``That figure will increase to one-third in
the early 1990s,'' she predicted. ``The money is targeted to those
students and there has been a proliferation of those schools.''
   Despite the falloff in college aid, a record proportion of
freshmen said they were interested in pursuing advanced degrees _
58.7 percent, compared with 48.3 percent in 1980.
   ``The rising degree aspirations suggest that a growing proportion
of students feel the bachelor's degree will not be an adequate
credential in the job market during the next decade and into the
next century,'' said Kenneth C. Green, associate director of the
survey.
   In line with that, a record 72.6 percent of the freshmen
indicated ``making more money'' was a very important factor in their
decision to attend college. By contrast, the proportion who said
they were going to college ``to gain a general education'' declined
for the 11th straight year, to 60.1 percent.
   Examining personal habits, the survey also found that a 22-year
decline in smoking may be reversing itself. In 1966, 16.6 percent of
the freshmen said they were frequent smokers. That fell steadily to
8.9 percent in 1987, but rose to 10.1 percent among those entering
college last fall.
   A record high percentage of freshmen (10.5 percent) said they
frequently felt depressed, while there was no real change in those
rating their emotional health as above average (56.1 percent, as
opposed to 56.8 percent in 1987).
   Survey director Alexander Astin of UCLA said the survey revealed
several potential sources of increased stress for students,
including concern about paying for college; increased interest in
advanced degrees; and tougher competition for admission to selective
institutions.
   On the career front, the survey found that freshman interest in
entering the business world to be leveling off _ 24.6 percent in
1987 and 23.6 percent in 1988 _ after two decades of steady gains.
The results ``suggest that student interest in business careers may
have reached a plateau after the dramatic increases of the 1970s and
1980s,'' survey officials said.
   Student interest in teaching rose from 8.1 percent in 1987 to 8.8
percent in 1988, reflecting a trend that started in 1983 after
interest had bottomed out at 4.7 percent in 1982.
   But interest in science careers, steadily falling in popularity
for the last 20 years, remained low. Only 5.8 percent of the
freshmen said they planned to pursue science majors, compared with 6
percent in 1987 and 11.5 percent in 1973.

<TEXT>
   Iran's foreign minister said today that prospects
for success in Iran-Iraq peace talks are dim, but he said his
country is ready to agree to an international ban on chemical
weapons whether or not Iraq signs.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, attending an international
conference on chemical weapons, said he had met with U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to discuss the 8-year-old
Iran-Iraq war.
   A cease-fire began Aug. 20 and negotiations aimed at achieving a
lasting peace began a few days later.
   ``The situation remains volatile and prospects for progress are
dim,'' Velayati told reporters. ``Five months after the cease-fire,
Iraq is still in our territory.''
   Tehran Radio said today, ``The Islamic Republic has always
demonstrated its willingness to participate in the talks, but until
(while) Iraq continues to introduce subterfuges, a resumption of
talks will achieve nothing.''
   The commentary, monitored in Nicosia, gave the strongest
indication yet that Iran may not return to the negotiating table
without guarantees of concrete results.
   The U.N. Security Council and all countries which support its
cease-fire resolution ``must not expect Iran to be optimistic about
the talks until (while) Iraq still refuses to withdraw from Iranian
territory,'' said the broadcast.
   Tehran's accusation that Baghdad is dragging its feet comes
several days after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein claimed Iran was
massing troops along the 730-mile border and probably planning ``new
aggression.'' He also accused Tehran of stalling in the peace talks.
   In Paris, Velayati said Perez de Cuellar is sending high-level
envoys to Baghdad and Tehran soon, and ``we welcome them.''
   Iraq has used chemical weapons, and Velayati called his
countrymen ``the most conspicuous victims'' of violations of the
1925 Geneva Protocol, which bans the use of such weapons. Iraq
admitted using chemical weapons in the war but said Iran used them
first.
   Velayati repeated Iranian claims that his country did not use the
weapons.
   Asked if Iran would be willing to sign an accord expanding the
chemical weapons ban if Iraq refused to sign, Velayati said: ``We
are ready to participate in any global or regional activities on
chemical weapons.''
   Velayati also said he met early today with William Waldegrave,
head of the British delegation, to discuss British hostages being
held in Lebanon.
   He said Iran had been asked for help and that in the past they
had tried to assist ``France, West Germany, even the United States''
in obtaining freedom for hostages held in Lebanon.
   ``We do hope all nationals will be released,'' he said.
   Fifteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are held hostage in
Lebanon. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16,
1985.

<DATELINE>NABLUS, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven Palestinians were
reported shot and wounded in clashes with Israeli troops today, and
a general strike shut down the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The daily Haaretz newspaper said Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
had renewed secret contacts with Palestinians to discuss holding
municipal elections in the occupied territories for the first time
since 1976.
   Meetings at Rabin's Tel Aviv office were held in secret to
protect Arab participants from attacks by Palestinian nationalists,
the Hebrew-language paper said.
   The PLO-backed underground leadership of the 13-month uprising
rejected Israeli moves for elections and called for escalation of
the Arab revolt in a leaflet distributed in the territories.
   The army imposed curfews on four Gaza Strip refugee camps and two
neighborhoods of Gaza City and Rafah, confining 135,000 Palestinians
to their homes.
   A military spokesman confirmed four Palestinians were wounded
during clashes with troops in the West Bank refugee camp of Farah,
near Nablus. He said the army was checking other reported casualties.
   Arab hospital officials said two of the wounded were in critical
condition with bullet wounds to the stomach.
   Three other teen-agers were hospitalized with less serious bullet
wounds, according to hospital officials.
   Also today, Arab residents of the West Bank village of Kfar Nakif
threw a firebomb at an Israeli car, which exploded but caused no
damage, Arab reports said. The attack prompted a raid on the village
by a group of Jewish settlers, who threw rocks that damaged two
Palestinian cars, the reports said.
   The army said it was investigating the report.
   In Gaza City, residents hung outlawed Palestinian flags and
photographs of PLO chief Yasser Arafat from electricity lines,
according to Arab reporters.
   Troops used tear gas to break up a demonstration in the West Bank
refugee camp of Dheishe, near Bethlehem, after youths began stoning
soldiers guarding the camp entrance.
   By official count, 348 palestinians and 15 Israelis have been
killed in the uprising.
   The strike call by the PLO-backed leadership came after a
shutdown was ordered by a rival Islamic fundamentalist group, Hamas,
which means ``Zeal'' in Arabic.
   Past Hamas strikes have sparked confrontations with PLO
supporters who demanded merchants not obey the orders. But
Palestinians close to the leadership said the group decided to avoid
confrontation this time.
   ``The United Leadership has started to realize that Hamas has the
power to enforce a strike and they wanted credit for today's
strike,'' said a pro-PLO activist who gave his name only as Ghassan.
   Hamas supporters warned merchants with graffiti in the West Bank
city of Nablus. ``Any merchant who opens his shop will find it
torched to the ground,'' said the warnings painted in red.
   Other slogans signed by Hamas and the extremist Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command criticized recent moves
for a negotiated settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   ``No to negotiation, no to recognition of Israel,'' said one
slogan.

<HEAD>The Federal Deficit</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The one area in which I have been persistently disappointed
throughout my term of office has been in the efforts to bring the
budget under control.
   Time and again I have proposed measures to help curb federal
domestic program spending. Time and again these proposals have been
rejected by Congress.
   The reasons for the rise in the federal deficit in the early
1980s are simple.
   First, we experienced one of the most severe recessions of the
postwar period.
   It has been estimated that 81 percent _ over $640 billion _ of
the growth of the deficit over the 1981-1986 levels originally
projected in my March 1981 budget was attributable to that recession.
   The second reason is that, even after including necessary
increases for defense, my March 1981 budget called for net spending
reductions totaling $331 billion over five years; but Congress
approved less than 40 percent of those reductions.
   Wasteful programs continued to be funded.
   The necessary reductions have still not been made.
   If the deficit is not curbed by continuing to limit the appetite
of government, we put in jeopardy all that we worked so hard over
the years to achieve.
   Large deficits brought on by excessive domestic spending undercut
the incentives to work and save by absorbing the savings that would
otherwise lead to productive investment.
   We cannot allow this to happen.

   Maintaining peace and protecting our country are the foremost

   Defense budget authority declined in real (inflation-adjusted)

1989.
   This trend cannot continue without severe impact on combat
readiness.
   Therefore, my budget requests defense funding of $315 billion in
budget authority and $303 billion in outlays for 1990, and $331
billion in budget authority and $314 billion in outlays in 1991.
   These amounts provide 2 percent annual real growth in budget
authority over the 1989 level, bringing it back up to the 1984 level
in inflation-adjusted terms by 1991.
   The budget also projects 2 percent real growth in these programs
in future years.
   We must continue to maintain our nuclear deterrent.
   For 1990, the budget proposes $9 billion for atomic energy
defense programs, a $0.9 billion increase over 1989.

nuclear materials production complex and to increase environmental

<HEAD>Court Bars Local Governments From Receiving Some Revenue Sharing
Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today barred local
governments from receiving $180 million in federal revenue sharing
funds withheld by the Reagan administration.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that the money
properly was withheld under budget cuts imposed by the so-called
Gramm-Rudman Act.
   Congress appropriated more than $4 billion for revenue sharing
for the 1986 fiscal year.
   After Gramm-Rudman was enacted _ a law aimed at eliminating the
federal budget deficit by 1991 _ President Reagan ordered $180
million in revenue sharing funds withheld in 1986.
   Later that year, Congress passed and Reagan signed a law
repealing the revenue sharing program.
   Representatives of local governments in early 1987 asked the
Reagan administration to pay the $180 million that had been held
back the previous year. The administration refused the request.
   The local governments then went to federal court and a judge
ordered the government to pay the $180 million.
   But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last March that
the administration acted properly.
   The appeals court said the intent of Gramm-Rudman was not merely
to freeze budget cuts temporarily.
   ``Merely freezing the fiscal year 1986 entitlements and
resuscitating them in fiscal year 1987... would not result in any
meaningful deficit reduction and could be characterized by critics
to be a sham,'' the appeals court said.
   Barring the local governments from receiving the money ``may be
harsh,'' the appeals court added. ``But we believe it is consistent
with congressional intent.''
   The case is National Association of Counties vs. Brady, 88-505.

<HEAD>Justices to Consider Ban on Sex Calls in California Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether Congress may outlaw all sexually explicit telephone dial-up
message services, known as ``dial-a-porn.''
   The justices will rule, sometime by July, on the validity of a
1988 law that sought to ban all obscene and indecent messages
available through dial-a-porn services.
   A federal judge in California ruled that the law could be applied
to ban all obscene messages, but he struck down the law's ban on
messages deemed merely indecent.
   U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima in Los Angeles based his
July 19 ruling on past Supreme Court decisions that excluded obscene
material _ but not all sexually explicit or indecent material _ from
constitutional free-speech protections.
   The Reagan administration appealed directly to the Supreme Court,
challenging the part of the July ruling that protects indecent
material.
   Sable Communications of California Inc., a major purveyor of
dial-a-porn services in that state, filed a counter-appeal
challenging the part of Tashima's ruling that allows the ban on
materials judged to be obscene.
   Today, the justices granted review to both appeals.
   Twice in 1988 the justices had refused to review dial-a-porn
controversies, in cases from Arizona and New York.
   Obscenity is a legal term that does not apply to all sexually
explicit material.
   The Supreme Court since 1973 has defined obscenity as a work that
appeals to a morbid interest in sex with patently offensive
depictions or descriptions of sexual conduct, and one that taken as
a whole has no serious literary, artistic, political or scientific
value.
   Sexually explicit material, often called pornography, may or may
not be legally obscene.
   In 1978, the high court drew a distinction between obscene and
``indecent'' expression when it allowed federal regulators to
restrict the broadcast of indecent language.
   Upholding the government's power to punish use of ``dirty words''
over the airwaves at times when children might be listening, the
court seemed to adopt the Federal Communications Commission's
definition of indecent _ ``patently offensive references to
excretory and sexual organs or activities.''
   Congress in 1983 imposed restrictions on the dial-a-porn business
but did not seek a total ban until enacting the 1988 law.
   ``Congress concluded that there was no sufficiently effective
measure to eliminate access of children to dial-a-porn short of an
outright ban,'' Justice Department lawyers told the court.
   They said the court's 1978 decision restricting the broadcasting
of indecent language ``suggests that (the 1988 law) is consistent
with the First Amendment,'' the constitutional protection of freedom
of speech.
   The government's appeal acknowledged, however, that the FCC's
general counsel has said the commission believes the 1978 Supreme
Court ruling does not authorize a total ban on merely indecent
language.
   Lawyers for Sable Communications argued that the entire 1988 law
should be struck down.
   Dial-a-porn companies make their services available to callers
through 976-exchange numbers and AT&amp;T's area code 900 long-distance
lines.
   The telephone company typically charges callers according to
per-call rates, retaining a portion of the charges and giving the
remainder to the dial-a-porn company.
   The 976 and 900 exchanges also are used for other,
non-controversial types of messages such as sports scores, time
checks and stock market reports.
   The cases are FCC vs. Sable Communications, 88-525, and Sable
Communications vs. FCC, 88-515.

<HEAD>Court to Decide if Justice Must Supply Magazine with Tax Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether the Justice Department must supply a weekly tax magazine
with copies of all federal trial court opinions and orders in tax
cases.
   The justices said they will review a ruling that the Freedom of
Information Act imposes such an obligation on the Justice
Department's tax division.
   Government lawyers, warning of ``enormous administrative costs
and burdens'' at taxpayer expense, contend that the 1966 law imposes
no such obligation.
   Tax Analysts, a Washington-based weekly magazine reporting
legislative, judicial and regulatory developments in federal
taxation, first invoked the FOIA in 1984 in seeking timely copies of
federal court opinions and orders from the Justice Department.
   Such opinions and orders are available to the public from the
individual courts but the magazine had difficulty in obtaining them
quickly.
   The Justice Department's tax division turned down the magazine's
FOIA requests, and a federal trial judge upheld the denial.
   But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last April 29
that the government must comply with the magazine's FOIA requests.
   ``Imposing an enormous and costly administrative burden on the
Justice Department to secure already publicly available material for
a commercial publication is certainly not the commonly perceived
purpose of the FOIA,'' the appeals court said. ``Nonethleless, we
cannot find in the words of the statute any exemption to cover such
a situation.''
   The appeals court added that ``the burden in this case may not be
so excessive as the department makes out.''
   Government lawyers estimate that complying with the Tax Analysts
requests on a regular basis would cost nearly $75,000 a year for
search time alone.
   They say commercial publishers and law firms would flood the
Justice Department with similar FOIA requests if the appeals court
ruling is not overturned.
   The appeals court ruled that federal trial court opinions and
orders sent to the Justice Department are ``agency records'' under
the FOIA, and that they are being ``improperly withheld'' from the
tax magazine.
   In the appeal acted on today, government lawyers said the appeals
court was wrong on both points.
   The case is Justice Department vs. Tax Analysts, 88-782.

<HEAD>Seven Skiers Survive Storm, Avalanche on Mount Rainier</HEAD>

   Seven skiers spent a night in a makeshift snow
shelter and then survived an avalanche after getting lost during a
sudden storm on Mount Rainier.
   ``It was an extremely calm and well-organized group, which really
made a big difference,'' Lonnie Rosenwald, 33, of Seattle. Their
ordeal ended safely Sunday when the group members met up with a
rescue team on their way down the mountain.
   Still, she said, ``There were lots of times we thought our lives
were in danger. There were times we didn't think we were going to
get out of there.''
   The skiers, all experienced at wilderness survival, left Saturday
on what was supposed to be a one-day back-country ski trip to the
Muir snowfield on the south flank of the 14,410-foot mountain. While
they were attempting to return that afternoon, a storm closed in and
they got lost in a steep valley, Rosenwald said.
   The skiers, on a trip sponsored by the Seattle Mountaineers Club,
tried until midnight to climb out of the valley and then decided to
build a structure and a small fire to survive the night.
   ``It was a wonderful structure,'' said Rosenwald. ``It was a
six-foot by three-foot hole in the snow, with a roof consisting of
skis, poles, and pine boughs covered by snow. It was rectangular. It
snowed all night and we stayed dry.''
   The group members, ranging in age from 31 to 68, was experienced
and fit and had proper clothing, Rosenwald said. No one panicked,
and no one got dangerously cold.
   On Sunday morning, as the skiers set out to return, five of them
were caught in an avalanche, Rosenwald said. Everyone was able to
``swim'' through the 200-foot slide safely except for one man, who
hit a tree and was slightly injured.
   They then opted to ski down the creek valley, correctly guessing
that it would take them to a road that leads to a National Park
Service facility at Paradise.
   Just before dusk, the group met a Rescue team that had been
searching for them in heavy snow and winds since daybreak Sunday.
   ``It was nice to see the rescuers, but we would have made it,''
Rosenwald said. ``There were 12 of them. They had food and water and
dry clothing. ... The park service brought us to Paradise, and let
us warm up.''
   Park ranger Bill Dengler said the skiers were in ``good condition
and delighted to get back inside and get into a warm area, out of
the cold.''

<HEAD>Mother Who Refused to Disclose Whereabouts of Daughter Loses Appeal</HEAD>

   A mother jailed since August 1987 for refusing
to disclose the whereabouts of her daughter, whom she says was
sexually abused by the child's father, lost a Supreme Court appeal
today.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a contempt citation
against Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, a District of Columbia plastic surgeon.
   Morgan, 41, was imprisoned in August 1981 for defying an order by
District of Columbia Judge Herbert B. Dixon Jr. that she allow her
daughter, Hilary, then 5, to spend a two-week unsupervised visit
with Dr. Eric A. Foretich.
   Foretich is Hilary's father and Morgan's former husband.
   Morgan sent the child into hiding to protect her, she said, from
sexual abuse by Foretich, who has denied abusing his daughter.
   The judge last Dec. 15 refused to free Morgan after more than 15
months in jail, saying he is not convinced her imprisonment will
fail to coerce her into disclosing Hilary's whereabouts.
   ``The coercion has only just begun,'' Dixon said. He added, ``It
could be a month, it could be a year, it could be more than that''
before he is convinced ``there is no realistic possibility of her
relenting.''
   Morgan has been held in civil contempt, imposed to coerce someone
into complying with a court order. The citation requires
imprisonment for an indefinite period. Criminal contempt, by
contrast, is imposed for a limited sentence as punishment.
   In her Supreme Court appeal, Morgan said her rights were violated
because Dixon conducted much of the hearing that led to the contempt
citation in private.
   The judge said he was trying to protect Hilary from public
disclosure of the details of her father's alleged sexual abuse. Many
of the specific charges were made public in a separate federal court
suit against Foretich by Morgan.
   Dixon ruled in 1986 that Morgan failed to prove Foretich had
abused Hilary. He said there was equal evidence on both sides of the
case. The judge permitted brief supervised visits for the father,
and in August 1987 granted Foretich a two-week unsupervised visit
that led Morgan to send her daughter into hiding.
   Morgan said Dixon was biased against her, and wrongly refused to
believe evidence indicating Hilary had been abused.
   An appeals court here ruled last August that Morgan's rights were
not violated.
   ``A review of the record shows that there was proabable evidence
on both sides of the issue of abuse,'' the appeals court said. It
added that it is unable to conclude that Dixon was ``clearly
erroneous'' in granting Foretich a two-week visit.
   The appeals court noted that a court-appointed guardian for
Hilary opposed the visit but had not argued that Dixon abused his
discretion in ordering the visit.
   The appeals court also upheld Dixon's decision to bar the public
from hearing Morgan's testimony about specific alleged acts of
sexual abuse.
   Morgan said the public has been prevented from hearing crucial
evidence that is vital to an issue of national debate.
   Her lawyers said studies show that sex abuse charges are made in
some 2 percent of contested custody and visitation cases.
   Calling the figure one of ``alarming frequency,'' they said
doubts have been raised about the ability of judges to referee such
disputes.
   Growing numbers of ``desperate parents have ... taken their
children and disappeared'' because the parents ``have lost faith in
the willingness and ability of the judicial system to protect their
children,'' Morgan's appeal said.
   The case is Morgan vs. Foretich, 88-737.

   The world's first recipient of a heart-liver
transplant is back in Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh for tests on
her liver.
   Stormie Jones, 11, was admitted around midnight Sunday, said
hospital spokeswoman Lynn McMahon. Her mother, Lois Purcell,
accompanied her from their home in White Settlement, Texas.
   Stormie looks well and is in good condition, but recent blood
tests found elevated levels of body toxins that the liver should be
removing, said Miss McMahon.
   Doctors Thomas Starzl and Henry Bahnson performed Stormie's
pioneering transplant operation at Children's Hospital in February
1984 when she was endangered by hyper-cholesterolemia, a disorder in
which great amounts of fat accumulate in the blood.
   She returned last October for reconstruction of a bile duct.
   Miss McMahon said it was not clear whether her new symptoms are
related to the bile duct problem.

<HEAD>Justices to Consider New Orleans Electric Service Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether federal courts should referee some disputes over electric
power rates between public utilities and local or state regulatory
agencies.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by New Orleans Public
Service Inc., a utility company seeking to pass on to its customers
$135 million in costs.
   The high court, in a related ruling last June, severely limited
the authority of states to lower electric rates that public
utilities charge as a result of agreements with federal regulators.
   But that decision left unanswered whether federal judges should
rule in such disputes or leave these matters to state courts.
   The case acted on today stems from a nearly decade-old dispute
between New Orleans Public Service, or NOPSI, and the city council,
which under Louisiana law sets utility rates charged consumers in
New Orleans.
   The council barred NOPSI from charging customers for the costs
the utility incurred in buying electric power generated by the $3.6
billion Grand Gulf 1 nuclear power plant in Port Gibson, Miss.
   The rates charged NOPSI to purchase power from Grand Gulf were
set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
   Therefore, NOPSI argued, city and state officials are powerless
to prevent it from passing on the costs to its customers.
   The federal commission in 1985 ordered NOPSI to pay 17 percent of
the cost of constructing Grand Gulf 1.
   NOPSI, in a partial settlement with the city council in 1986,
agreed to absorb $51.2 million of the costs of Grand Gulf.
   NOPSI said the city gave assurances it would be allowed to
recover the remaining $135 million share of its costs through higher
retail rates over a period of time.
   But the council said the utility acted imprudently in failing to
resell the power it agreed to purchase from Grand Gulf and blocked a
pass-through.
   NOPSI sued in federal court for permission to pass on the $135
million to its customers, arguing that the federal commission's role
in the matter preempted the city council's power.
   A federal judge denied NOPSI's claim, and the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals upheld the ruling last July.
   The appeals court said, ``A federal court with jurisdiction over
a matter that also lies within the jurisdiction of a state court or
agency should abstain from exercising its jurisdiction. New Orleans
Public Service must seek relief elsewhere.''
   The Reagan administration urged the Supreme Court to overrule the
5th Circuit court and order the federal courts to decide the dispute.
   The Justice Department said that at the very least it should be
made clear that federal courts have power to allow utilities to pass
on such costs temporarily to customers while the case is pending in
the courts.
   ``A delay in passing those costs through in retail rates will
often have consequences that are irreparable,'' government lawyers
said. ``It may create immediate cash flow problems and uncertainties
that may threaten bankruptcy, impede securities offerings and force
compromise settlements.''
   The case is New Orleans Public Service vs. New Orleans City
Council, 88-348.

<TEXT>
   George Bush today studied President Reagan's
$1.15 trillion budget, and a transition official said the
president-elect ``agrees with its intent'' although still planned to
submit his own modifications.
   Bush transition spokeswoman Sheila Tate said that the vice
president himself might issue a brief statement on it later in the
day.
   But another transition official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that Bush was prepared to say that Reagan's spending
outline ``says for one thing that you can meet the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings targets without raising taxes.''
   It was a reference to the federal spending law that limits the
deficit in the fiscal 1990 year _ the one the new budget covers _ to
no more than $100 billion. The Reagan document envisions a $92.5
billion deficit.
   ``It's a good budget that does that,'' the Bush transition
official continued. ``Naturally, he agrees with its intent. And,
naturally, he'll have his own recommendations, or put forth
potential amendments, once he takes office.''
   ``But he won't be presenting any of those recommendations until
he's prepared to present all of them to the Congress, whatever time
that might be,'' the official said.
   The Reagan budget was designed, in part, to smooth the way for
the upcoming Bush budget plan, Reagan administration and Bush
transition officials said.
   Outgoing Budget Director Joseph R. Wright Jr. said Sunday the
final Reagan budget was designed with a ``dual purpose'' in mind,
summing up Reagan's philosophy while providing Bush ``with a good
base to begin negotiations with Congress.''
   Bush himself has said he won't submit a completely new plan of
his own, but will outline what he'll ``add here and take off
there,'' much of it to be spelled out in an address to a joint
session of Congress in early February.
   Congressional Democratic leaders have indicated they would like
to get Bush's final budget plan by no later than Feb. 20 so Congress
can begin work on its own budget and meet the goal of finishing work
on spending bills before the August recess.
   And leaders are indicating they are giving Bush the benefit of
the doubt on his much-touted concept of a ``flexible freeze'' to
hold overall spending increases generally to the rate of inflation _
but without a tax increase.
   ``My own view is that is very difficult,'' Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Sunday on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.''
   But, he continued: ``(Bush) has said it can be done and that he
will do it. ... My feeling is let's give him a chance to see if he
meant what he said and if he can do what he promised.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, appearing on the
same program, said he believes Bush is committed to his campaign
pledge not to raise taxes. ``I think George Bush meant it and if
people don't read lips in this town, I think they are going to be
left out somewhere,'' Dole said.
   Reagan's final gift to Bush is a fiscal 1990 budget document that
appears to meet that mathematical goal. Reagan's plan calls for
spending increases of 4.5 percent _ comparable to the 1988 rate of
inflation of about 4.4 percent.
   Under the Bush ``flexible freeze,'' any increased spending must
be offset in general by reductions in other areas.
   And, while Bush is certain to come up with his own specifics to
bring about some of the ``kinder, gentler nation'' programs he
talked about in his campaign, Reagan's budget appears to open the
way for such changes.
   Rather than calling for wholesale elimination of agencies and
programs, as past Reagan budgets have done, the new plan was
expected to be more selective, singling out specific programs and
spending items instead.
   That will make it easier for Bush to shape his own budget outline
by offering amendments to the Reagan plan.
   And some of Bush's pet campaign themes, including more funds for
education, were already contained in the Reagan proposal.
   ``There's no question, his (Bush's) first test of leadership will
be on this issue,'' Rep. Leon E. Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the
House Budget Committee, said.
   ``The real question will not be the news in the Reagan budget,
but how the new president responds to the challenges contained in
the Reagan budget,'' Panetta said in an interview.
   Bush and his lieutenants have maintained a low profile in the
preparation of the Reagan budget. However, his choice for budget
director, Richard G. Darman, has made frequent trips to Capitol Hill
to meet with Republican budget writers.
   In the meetings, Darman indicated the forthcoming Bush proposals
would be general, and that the incoming president would put greater
emphasis on negotiations with Congress, according to participants.
   Bush has said he would send his budget negotiating team, headed
by Darman, to meet with congressional leaders at the outset of his
presidency.
   Darman was kept closely informed on details of the preparation of
the final Reagan budget. And Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady _ a
close Bush confidant whom the vice president has announced he will
retain _ also played a role in shaping it.
   Wright, the outgoing Reagan budget director, said in an interview
on Sunday that the Reagan budget ``satisfies two requirements very
well.''
   ``It is President Reagan's last budget,'' he said. ``It is a
responsible, conservative budget. But it has also been put through a
reasonable test. If President-elect Bush wants to use it that way,
it provides him with a good base to begin negotiations with Congress
during a very tough year.''

   Other areas of federal responsibility receive priority funding in
this budget:
   _To continue the Federal Aviation Administration's multiyear
program to increase its controller and inspector workforces and to
modernize the nation's aid traffic control systems, the budget
provides $7.7 billion _ a 17 percent increase over the 1989 level.
   _To alleviate the problems facing our savings institutions, I
propose that the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation
(FSLIC) spend $16 billion in 1989 and $9 billion in 1990 to address
the most serious thrift institution problems.
   The secretary of the treasury is developing a comprehensive plan
to resolve the savings industry's problems, and reform the financial
institution regulatory structure and deposit insurance system to
prevent a reoccurrence of these problems.
   I expect the secretary to submit his proposals to the new
president shortly.
   _To improve coordination of federal rural development programs
and to redirect funding toward needy rural areas and program
recipients, I am continuing support of the rural development
initiative coordinated by the secretary of agriculture.
   _By emphasizing housing vouchers, I would provide housing
assistance to 132,000 additional low-income households in 1990, 5
percent more than the 126,124 additional households receiving
housing subsidies in 1989.
   Housing vouchers can serve more low-income households at a lower
federal cost and provide greater opportunity for these families to
rent housing of their own choosing.
   _To maintain the progress we have been making in fostering state
and local education reform, I would sustain the present level of
spending on discretionary education programs at $18.5 billion, but
refocus those funds to put more money where the needs of the
disadvantaged and students with handicaps are greatest.
   _To continue the significant progress we have made in cleaning up
the environment, I recommend a $153 million increase for the
Environmental Protection Agency's regulatory, research and
enforcement programs.
   I also recommend an increase of $315 million for the Superfund
hazardous waste cleanup program in order to maintain the program's
momentum and support a stronger enforcement role.
   _Because changes in the Earth's natural systems can have
tremendous economic and social effects, global climate change is
becoming a critical concern.
   Our ability to understand and predict these changes is currently
limited, and a better understanding is essential for developing
policies.
   The budget proposes a coordinated and effective federal research
program on global change.
   This budget is accompanied by a report by the Committee on Earth
Sciences that describes this program and its strategy.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Revive Bendectin Lawsuits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive
lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages in behalf of
children with birth defects allegedly caused by the anti-nausea drug
Bendectin.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by more than 800
families who sued Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, the maker of
Bendectin, in federal court in Ohio.
   Merrell Dow had agreed in a 1984 settlement to create a $120
million fund to compensate children with birth defects alledly
caused by their mothers' use during pregnancy of Bendectin.
   Under the terms of the settlement, the company did not admit the
drug had caused the defects.
   The settlement later was rejected by a federal appeals court,
which reinstated the suits against Merrell Dow. A federal jury
decided after a 22-day trial in 1985 that Bendectin did not cause
birth defects when taken in prescribed doses.
   The case was tried in Ohio because Merrell Dow has its
headquarters in Hamilton County there.
   The families that sued said they were denied a fair trial in part
because the presiding judge barred children under 10 and all
children with visible deformities from attending the trial. The
judge said allowing the young children and deformed children to
attend could inflame the jury and prejudice the case against Merrell
Dow.
   Those children were permitted to watch the trial on
closed-circuit television elsewhere in the court building.
   Also, the trial judge limited the trial's focus to determining
whether the families could prove that Bendectin causes birth defects.
   Only if the families were successful on that issue _ and they
were not _ would they then have had the opportunity at subsequent
trials to show that Merrell Dow was legally responsible for the
defects and to establish how much money the company must pay.
   The families said splitting up the issues in this manner unfairly
prevented them from presenting evidence that Merrell Dow was
negligent, guilty of fraud, failed to warn mothers of the drug's
dangers and violated a federal law on branding of drugs.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last August that the
trial judge did not act improperly in imposing the restrictions.
   The appeals court rejected arguments that splitting up the trial
and barring young children and those with deformities from attending
created a ``sterile atmosphere'' that was unfair to the plaintiffs.
   ``Sterility is not necessarily the inevitable
consequence...merely because the jury may not hear the full evidence
of defendant's alleged wrongdoing,'' the appeals court said.
   The case is Hoffman vs. Merrell Dow, 88-704.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Missouri Decision on Grand Jury Members</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today turned away arguments
that judges violate free-speech rights when keeping secret the names
of people selected as grand jury members.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a Missouri judge's
decision to bar public inspection of the names of grand jurors in a
double-murder investigation.
   St. Charles County Judge Lester W. Duggan convened a grand jury
last June to investigate James H. Williams Sr. and his wife, JoAnn
Williams.
   The couple was accused in the murder of Walter Scott, Mrs.
Williams' first husband.
   Williams also was accused of killing his ex-wife, Sharon Williams.
   After a reporter for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch asked for the
names of the grand jury members, Duggan ordered the names be kept
confidential ``in the interest of the safety and welfare'' of each
grand juror.
   The Pulitzer Publishing Co., which owns the newspaper, sought to
force Duggan to release the names but a state appeals court voted,
2-1, to uphold his orders.
   The Missouri Supreme Court turned down the newspaper's appeal
last Sept. 13.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the Post-Dispatch
argued that ``access to the names of those serving on the grand jury
should be presumed open.''
   They said any judge should be required to explain the special
circumstances existing before the presumption of openness could be
overriden.
   A practice of keeping the names of grand jury members secret
``may lead to the erosion of public confidence in both state and
federal grand juries,'' the appeal said.
   Past Supreme Court rulings, relying on the ``historical
openness'' of court proceedings and the free-speech guarantees of
the Constitution's First Amendment, have recognized the public's
right to attend criminal trials, including jury selection and
pretrial hearings.
   The newspaper's appeal said those decisions should be extended to
include access to grand jurors' names.
   But St. Charles County prosecutors urged the justices to reject
the Post-Dispatch's appeal.
   They drew a distinction between open trials and traditionally
closed grand jury proceedings, saying the latter ``are not subject
to the same rigid procedural safeguards.''
   The previously most recent grand jury in St. Charles County had
been convened in 1978, and names of grand jurors were made public
then.
   But county prosecutors said the 1978 grand jury was investigating
the purchase and renovation of a building, not ``a highly
publicized, gruesome double homicide.''
   ``Public policy dictates that jurors investigating a double
homicide would reasonably require a greater level of protection ...
from possible reprisals or pressure,'' the prosecutors said.
   The case is Pulitzer Publishing Co. vs. Duggan, 88-770.

   The owner of the town's only theater
vowed not to show the film ``Mississippi Burning,'' a fictionalized
account of the killings of three civil rights workers here 25 years
ago.
   ``We're not going to show it. No way. It's not worth it,'' Lula
Ellis, who owns the Ellis theater, said Sunday. ``I just see no
reason why we should play it.''
   Ellis had said that church groups were threatening to boycott the
theater if it showed the movie, directed by Alan Parker and starring
Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe.
   On June 21, 1964, civil rights workers James Earl Chaney, 21, who
was black, and whites Andrew Goodman, 20, and Michael Schwerner, 24,
disappeared after they were released from jail in Philadelphia. They
had been stopped on speeding charges after they had been
investigating the burning of a church by the Ku Klux Klan.
   The three were found 44 days later, shot to death and buried in a
soggy earthen dam in Neshoba County.
   Ellis, who earlier this week said she hadn't made up her mind
about showing the film, said Sunday she reached a decision against
the movie after after discussing it with her son Shelly Steiger, the
theater manager.
   The movie has refocused national attention on this town of 6,800
people, which is 70 miles northwest of Jackson. The film has been
released in five cities and is scheduled for nationwide release
Friday.
   During most movies at Ellis' cinema, blacks customarily sit in
the balcony, with whites, a few blacks and Choctaw Indians sit down
in the orchestra seats. Steiger said this was by custom and was not
required by the theater management.
   Other theaters in Mississippi will run the movie.
   Monte Royal, owner of two cinemas in Meridian, which is about 40
miles southeast of Philadelphia, said he will feature the film by
Feb. 10.
   ``Even though the picture is fiction based on a factual incident,
it is indeed pertinent and part of our past,'' Royal said.

   The Supreme Court today refused to grant a
college professor access to sealed grand jury records in the case of
Owen J. Lattimore, a China scholar accused in the 1950s of being a
communist sympathizer.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Prof. Robert P.
Newman of the University of Pittsburgh, who is writing a Lattimore
biography.
   Lattimore, 88, and now retired in Pawtucket, R.I., was accused by
the late Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy, R-Wis., of helping to ``lose
China'' to the communists.
   A professor at Johns Hopkins University in the 1950s and an
expert in Asian affairs, Lattimore was indicted on perjury charges
by a federal grand jury after the Justice Department accused him of
lying to a congressional committee.
   Before that committee, he had denied ever being a communist agent
or sympathizer.
   Parts of the government's case were declared unconstitutional in
1952, and again in 1955 a judge threw out another indictment. The
government then dropped Lattimore's prosecution.
   Public Citizen, an organization representing Newman, said the
grand jury records could provide valuable insights into the McCarthy
era.
   ``The Lattimore indictments call into question the extent to
which unchecked prosecutorial power and congressional influence may
have been used to engineer a political prosecution and to employ the
grand jury for improper purposes,'' lawyers for Public Citizen said.
   Newman said the public has an important interest in being
informed about what happened in the grand jury probe.
   But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last April that
the rule for preserving grand jury secrecy ``makes no provision for
disclosure of transcripts to a private party for historical research
purposes.''
   Newman and Public Citizen said the ruling ``places critical
information about historically important chapters of history off
limits to historians and the public.''
   They said other courts have allowed public disclosure of grand
jury testimony when it is in the public interest even if federal
rules do not authorize specifically opening the files to help
historians.
   The Reagan administration urged the Supreme Court to reject
Newman's appeal.
   ``Even if dressed up as a significant project of historical
scholarship, requests of (this) type...could not easily be
distinguished from journalistic inquiries into subjects of public
interest or requests based simply on individual or public
curiosity,'' the Justice Department said.
   The case is Newman vs. U.S., 88-548.

<HEAD>MAJOR PROGRAMS ARE REFORMED TO ACHIEVE DEFICIT REDUCTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The program structure and incentives underlying many domestic
federal programs need to be altered to promote greater efficiency
and cost-effectiveness.
   _Current farm price support programs are far too costly.
   For the period 1986-89 an estimated $130 billion in federal
spending for farm-related assistance programs provided an average of
nearly $600,000 per farmer.
   Much of this assistance goes to farmers with high incomes _ more
than twice the U.S. family average.
   I therefore propose outlay reductions for the price and income
support programs of $2 billion in 1990 and additional annual
reductions of between $2 and $2.5 billion in each year from 1991
through 1994.
   In addition, I urge reform of the counterproductive sugar price
support program.
   _The rapidly rising costs of the Medicare program need to be
moderated.
   I propose a reasonable increase in the Medicare prospective
payment system rate and reductions in hospital capital payments and
special graduate medical education payments.
   Also, in an effort to restrain excessive growth in supplementary
medical insurance (SMI) costs, I propose extension of the current
law SMI premiums, limitations on physican payments, reductions in
payments for certain overpriced procedures, and reforms in the
durable medical equipment payment system.
   Medicare spending would still grow by 9 percent between 1989 and
1990 under these proposals _ but not by the 13 percent that would
occur under current law.

<HEAD>Court Acts in Ohio Water-Rate Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to bar
city-owned water systems from charging some non-resident customers
higher rates than other non-residents even if there is no
cost-related reason.
   The court, without comment, turned down an appeal by Summit
County, Ohio, officials who said they are being charged unfair rates
by Akron, Ohio.
   The case began in 1981 when Akron officials sued Summit County
for allegedly breaking a 1979 contract between the two governmental
bodies. The city said the county illegally wittheld payment for
water supplied by the city.
   The county countersued, claiming it entered into the contract
under duress and was being charged unreasonable and discriminatory
rates by Akron.
   The county said it was being charged rates some 90 percent higher
than another Akron water customer in the area, the neighboring city
of Tallmadge.
   Summit County said it was forced to pay more because it has no
alternative source of water.
   The Ohio Supreme Court upheld the higher rates for Summit County,
ruling county officials signed a contract with the city they must
honor.
   ``The degree of control which the courts will exert over such
(city-owned) public utilities is strictly limited to protecting
residents of the municipality from the imposition of rates which are
unreasonable or which discriminate among such residents,'' the state
court said.
   The Ohio court said it presumed that the contract signed by the
county was made ``through the normal give and take of contractual
negotiation.'' The county ``entered the bargaining process freely
and without duress.''
   The state court added there is nothing wrong in charging the
county higher rates based on its need for the water, even if Akron's
cost of supplying it is no greater than in providing water for
Tallmadge.
   ``Where rates for water from a municipally owned public utility
are set forth in a contract, such rates will not be struck down as
discriminatory even where no factor exists which could justify the
rate discrimination,'' the state court said.
   The case is Summit County vs. Akron, 88-596.

<HEAD>Budget Calls For Education Programs To Be Scrapped; Spending Up Slightly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration today proposed
eliminating two dozen federal education programs while slightly
increasing overall education outlays from $20.6 billion this year to
$21.2 billion in fiscal 1990.
   Some $541 million saved by the cuts, plus another $212 million
from cost savings officials hope to achieve from the guaranteed
student loan program, would go to expand existing programs for
disadvantaged students from kindergarten to graduate school.
   The proposed budget does not incorporate any of the education
spending ideas set forth during President-elect Bush's campaign.
They included a $500 million merit schools program for schools
serving disadvantaged children and a $50 million infusion for a
magnet schools program designed to encourage parental choice.
   But Bush, who pledged during the campaign to be ``the education
president,'' is expected to rework the budget in the weeks following
his Jan. 20 inauguration. The education community asserted last week
that he needs to request an extra $2.5 billion for fiscal 1990 in
order to begin to fulfill his pledge.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said last month that ``I did
the best I could'' to secure the best possible budget for his
department.
   The document does not contain specific new initiatives reflecting
his own priorities _ cutting illiteracy and the dropout rate _ but
that could come later. Cavazos has said that after Bush takes over,
``We will be getting into some rather specific kinds of programs.''
   Among the programs on the chopping block under the Reagan plan
are the Women's Educational Equity Act research program, which
officials complain has outlived its purpose, and a two-year dropout
prevention demonstration project due to expire.
   Also suggested for extinction are programs the administration
considers duplicative, and programs officials say should be financed
by the private sector. The latter include impact aid to school
districts serving areas with tax-exempt federal installations; Star
Schools, which would put satellite technology in schools; and a
number of scholarship and fellowship programs.
   The largest dollar increase under the Reagan plan _ and one of
the only boosts higher than the anticipated 3.4 percent inflation
rate _ would go to Pell grants, the chief federal assistance program
for low-income post-secondary students.
   Current budget authority for the program is nearly $4.5 billion.
That would rise by $256 million under the Reagan plan _ a 5.7
percent hike. The maximum grant amount of $2,300 would stay the same
and the number of students receiving aid would rise 46,000 to 3.1
million.
   Reagan would increase outlays for Chapter 1, the major federal
program for low-achieving children in poor neighborhoods, from the
current $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion in fiscal 1990. Most of the
extra money would be for grants funneled to areas with the highest
concentrations of needy students.
   The Reagan budget would hike spending authority for vocational
and bilingual education programs by about 3.4 percent. Spending
authority for vocational education would rise to $949 million while
bilingual would increase to $157 million. Outlays are anticipated to
be slightly less.
   The administration is hoping to save $212 million on the
guaranteed student loan program by reducing special allowance
payments used as an incentive to lenders to participate, and by
reducing guaranteed reinsurance to lenders and state guarantor
agencies from 100 percent to 90 percent on the dollar. Congress
would have to approve both moves.
   The entitlement program currently costs the government about $3.2
billion in interest and default payments. Officials expect loan
volume to rise from $11.5 billion this year to $12.5 billion in
fiscal 1990, adding another 278,000 students to the 4 million-plus
already participating in the program.

   The Archdiocese of Detroit softened a proposal to
close or merge 48 city parishes, but Cardinal Edmund Szoka said more
than a quarter of the city's 112 parishes still would close by June
30.
   Szoka announced Sunday that 30 mostly inner-city churches would
be closed, while an additional 25 parishes would be given a year to
prove their viability. In September, a task force had recommended
that 43 churches be closed and five others merged into parishes with
more members and greater resources.
   Even with the reduced number of parishes involved, there is no
precedent in the U.S. Roman Catholic church for such large-scale
closings, Msgr. John Tracy Ellis, a historian at the Catholic
University of America in Washington, said today.
   ``The situation was entirely different in the past,'' he said.
``It was a question of how many new parishes to open, not to close.
Insofar as I can recall, there is nothing like this.''
   The church closings were necessary, officials said, because of a
white flight from the city that reduced Detroit's Catholic
population from 100,000 housholds in 1976 to fewer than 50,000 today.
   ``The church, especially the church in the city of Detroit, finds
itself in much different circumstances in 1989 than those that
existed in '69, or '59, or '29, or 1909,'' Szoka said. ``It cannot
act as though nothing has changed.''
   Szoka, who had defended the earlier church closing plan, said
Sunday the 25 churches whose survival is in doubt would be asked to
increase membership, services and parish staff.
   ``All we are ask is that they try. ... I mention to them that in
no way is there a Damocles (sword) hanging over their head,'' he
said. ``It is meant rather to be a stimulus.''
   The cardinal called for more blacks to enter religious life in
his announcement Sunday and said he also intended the closings to
help end a ``plantation mentality,'' with white parish leaders
running churches attended largely by blacks.
   One of the 30 closing churches is expected to become a black
Catholic historical museum, he said.
   The announcement in September resulted in a wave of protest
against the 1.5 million-member archdiocese, which takes in six
counties in the Detroit area. There are an estimated 50,000 to
60,000 black Catholics in the archdiocese, church officials said.
   On Sunday, at Our Lady of the Rosary, one of many churches that
appealed the closing plan, parishioners were elated at the one-year
reprieve.
   ``There's a year and a pronouncement by the archdiocese to work
with parishes to see some sort of improvement,'' said Patrick
Gossman, a member of Our Lady of the Rosary. ``We'll go on with a
certain sense of hope and work at it.''
   But there was bitterness at churches slated to close.
   At St. Philip Neri, sniffling could be heard among the 70 people
attending Mass as the Rev. Donald Walker announced that the east
side church would close.
   ``This wasn't supposed to happen,'' Walker said, referring to the
difficulty he had in making the announcement. ``I guess you just
resent it when someone comes in and tells you it's time to die.''

<TEXT>
   Best-selling author Clive Cussler and some
300 volunteers found no signs during a weekend search of a
locomotive believed buried in a dry creek bed during an 1878 flood,
but he says they have not given up hope.
   ``In order to find it, we need to know where it isn't,'' Craig
Dirgo of Cussler's National Underwater and Marine Agency said Sunday
after the search ended. ``That's the key to any search.''
   Searchers braved 20-degree weather and gusty winds to sift
through a half-mile area near here for remnants of the
Kansas-Pacific locomotive.
   The engine, 19 cars and a caboose fell 30 feet from a railroad
bridge in 1878, when a flood struck the area 30 miles east of
Denver. Twelve of the cars and the locomotive were reported to have
been buried in the sand.
   Some researchers believe that the railroad subsequently salvaged
the expensive engine, but Cussler and his band of searchers are
still hoping it's still in the ground. The group hopes to squeeze in
one more weekend of hunting before spring to search a two-mile area
downstream from the original bridge.
   ``We know it's here and we will be back,'' Dirgo said.
   Volunteer Eric Walker of Darwin, Australia, found a part from a
railroad flat car. Others found slag and coal, which officials said
may have been used for ballast by the railroad.
   Cussler said if the locomotive is found, it will belong to the
landowner. Mike Pinzenscham, who watched the dig's progress with his
8-year-old son, Justin, said his family has owned the land for about
25 years.
   Through the Arvada-based agency, Cussler, the author of ``Raise
the Titanic,'' has located 54 sunken vessels including a dirigible.
But this is his first buried train hunt.
   The agency's next project will be a search for the steamship New
Orleans, which was built by Robert Fulton in 1811. Cussler said the
ship's bottom was torn out when it ran aground on a stump in the
Mississippi River at Baton Rouge, La.

   These reforms reinstate successful incentives employed in the
early 1980s.
   My budget also proposes restructuring federal financing of
administrative expenses to give states greater incentives to operate
their administrative systems as efficiently as possible.
   _The government often continues programs at the federal level
that are either duplicative or are no longer needed, or more
appropriately undertaken by other levels of government or the

   This is the case with the Economic Development Administration,
Amtrak, urban mass transit discretionary grants, and most operating
subsidies for the Postal Service.
   Efforts to reverse this situation have been undertaken by prior
administrations as well as my own.
   These programs should be eliminated.
   The budget proposes termination of 82 programs that are not
needed to satisfy national priorities.
   _Under current law, outlays for federal employee retirement and
health benefits are estimated to grow from $51.3 billion in 1989 to
$55.9 billion in 1990.
   I propose freezing retirement cost-of-living allowances (COLAs)
and other reforms to hold the 1990 level to slightly above that for

   Ghana's top diplomat today called on China to free
an African student arrested in a racial brawl, while other African
diplomats urged their students to end a class boycott begun by the
fighting.
   ``We are not satisfied. The case has not been handled properly,''
said Ghana's charge d'affaires, Kwadwo Kwakye. ``We want (him) to be
released.''
   Alex Dosoo of Ghana, a student at Hehai University in eastern
Nanking city, was arrested Dec. 31 and charged with beating and
seriously injuring a Hehai employee during the Dec. 24 clash.
   Police gave two other African students from Gambia and Benin 15
days ``disciplinary detention'' as punishment for having ``tried to
stir up trouble.''
   In a development apparently unrelated to the racial tensions, an
Ugandan medical student jumped from a sixth-floor dormitory window
at a campus in southern Canton city Friday, killing himself.
   Xinhua, the official news agency, said Nsubuga David Mugwanya,
26, had been depressed about financial problems and examination
failures.
   The clash between African students and Chinese school workers and
students began when the Africans brought Chinese women to a dance
Dec. 24.
   Kwakye said the fight ``happened on a campus and should have been
handled by the university and not handed over to the police.''
   In a telephone interview, he said he did not think Dosoo should
face criminal charges.
   He said authorities took three days to inform the embassy of
Dosoo's arrest and still have not advised them of any formal charges
or what punishment the student might face.
   ``We have protested his detention and the fact that we were not
notified,'' said Kwakye.
   He was among 11 African diplomats who met Chinese authorities and
African students in Nanking over the weekend.
   Kwakye said he told Ghanaian students today that ``it was within
their rights'' to boycott, ``but that they must be careful not to
contravene the law.''
   The official Xinhua News Agency quoted other diplomats as saying
they plan to advise their students to return to classes and obey the
law. The approximately 140 African students in Nanking have not
attended classes since the clash.
   About 500 African students at Beijing Languages Institute have
boycotted classes since Dec. 4 to protest charges by Chinese
students that an African man assaulted a Chinese woman in her
dormitory. The Africans say the story is fabricated and demand an
apology.
   Institute president Liu Bisong sent a letter today urging
boycotting students to return to class. Liu said Chinese students at
the school were wrong to protest last week, but that the class
boycott also was ``erroneous.''
   Ghana is the only African country that has said it is considering
bringing its 26 students in China home.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American who escaped a massacre at the hands
of the Japanese in World War II was reunited today with one of his
Filipino rescuers, 44 years after being freed.
   ``It was a great feeling,'' said Glenn McDole of Des Moines,
Iowa, describing his reaction to seeing Mary Anne Ancheta, now of
Algoma, Wis.
   In a brief appearance on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' show,
Mrs. Ancheta said the reunion fulfilled a longtime dream.
   ``All along I have been hoping that I would meet one of them,''
she said.
   In 1944, the malaria-weakened McDole and several other escapees
were brought to a Filipino guerrilla camp run by Maziro Major, Mrs.
Ancheta's father. Major, now 88, is retired after an Army career and
lives in Manila.
   At the time, Mrs. Ancheta was 7 years old. She said she
remembered McDole because he was the one ``shaking like a leaf''
from the effects of the disease, but she hadn't remembered his name.
   Last month, Mrs. Ancheta, now a nurse, saw an article about a
reunion of the prisoners of war. The story quoted McDole, and she
called him on New Year's Eve.
   That first attempt at a reunion ran afoul when the tape on
McDole's answering machine ran out before she could give her last
name and telephone number. But she tried again after reading an
article about McDole's anguish over missing the call from ``Mary
Anne from Wisconsin.'' The two chatted for the first time last week.
   McDole, 67, now chief of the patrol division in the Polk County
sheriff's office, said he was one of about 150 American prisoners
being held at Palawan Prison when American troops landed nearby.
   He said the captors ordered the prisoners into long trenches,
then threw gasoline and torches on them. About 20 prisoners broke
through the side of a trench and scrambled down a cliff to safety,
but many were shot before they could run away.
   McDole said he was treated and sheltered for about a month by
Major's group.

<HEAD>Reagan Would Spend More Than $1 Billion on AIDES</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan today asked Congress to
increase spending on AIDS research by 24 percent and trim the growth
of the huge Medicare and Medicaid health programs by cutting
payments to states and fees to hospitals and physicians.
   Overall, the proposed fiscal 1990 budget for the Department of
Health and Human Services would increase 5.7 percent to $424.4
billion in fiscal 1990.
   The department is the largest Cabinet agency in terms of
spending, accounting for 37 percent of federal outlays, including an
anticipated $257 billion on Social Security for the next fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1.
   The budget proposal would add $311 million to the fight against
the spread of the deadly acquired immune deficiency syndrome, ``our
highest public health priority.'' The increase would raise spending
for research, education and prevention of the disease to $1.6
billion.
   The department estimates another $925 million will be spent on
treatment and income support to AIDS victims through Medicaid,
Medicare, Disability Insurance and other service programs.
   The overwhelming bulk of the department's spending is earmarked
for entitlements _ Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid _ over
which the agency has little budget control since eligibility for the
programs is set by Congress.
   If no changes were made, Medicare _ which pays for the health
care of about 34 million elderly and disabled Americans _ would grow
by 14 percent in fiscal 1990.
   However, Reagan proposes trimming that growth rate to 10 percent
by cutting $3.5 billion from fees paid to physicians and hospitals.
His Medicare budget would total $94.9 billion.
   About a third of the Medicare cut, $1 billion, would come from
reducing the additional disbursements that teach hospitals receive
to cover their costs of training interns and residents.
   Other reductions would be made in payments to hospitals for
capital costs and fees to physicians for certain procedures,
including radiology, anesthesiology and surgery, under the Medicare
payments system.
   A new part of Medicare is the Catastrophic Health Insurance
program, which is intended to be entirely self-supporting. It is
financed by premiums paid by Medicare recipients, which are
projected to total about $8.6 billion in fiscal 1990. But the
program is projected to spend only $4 billion that year.
   Medicaid _ the program that provides health care for about 26
million low-income Americans _ would grow about 9 percent next year
if unchanged. The administration, however, is proposing to slice the
growth to 5 percent growth or by about $1.4 billion to a spending a
total of $36 billion.
   Much of the reduction would come from reducing payments to the
states, which administer the program under federal guidelines, by
about $1.1 billion.
   Benefits under the Social Security program are protected and
recipients. Based on administration estimates of what inflation will
be this year, the budget projects Social Security recipients getting
a 3.6 percent cost-of-living increase in their benefits in January
1990.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Agrees to Review Missouri Law Regulating Abortions</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts grafs 29-41, In other action, with other cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, acting in an appeal urging
reversal of its landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortion
nationwide, today agreed to review a Missouri law regulating
abortions.
   The justices said they will study a federal appeals court ruling
that struck down key provisions of the state law.
   Even before today's action in the appeal filed by Missouri
officials, the case had become the most-watched battleground in the
continuing political war over abortion. Justice Department lawyers
also are urging the high court to use the case as a means of undoing
its 1973 ruling, called Roe vs. Wade.
   But nothing in the brief order issued today suggested that the
justices will reconsider Roe vs. Wade.
   The court's eventual decision, expected by July, could resolve
the Missouri controversy without significantly changing the 1973
decision or other past rulings on abortion.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last July 13 struck down,
among other aspects of the Missouri abortion law, these five
provisions:
   _A ban on using public hospitals or other government-run
facilities for abortions not necessary to save a woman's life.
   _A ban prohibiting any public employee from performing or
assisting an abortion.
   _A ban on using taxpayer money for ``encouraging or counseling''
women to have abortions.
   _A requirement that doctors planning to abort a fetus believed to
be older than 19 weeks test for weight and lung capacity to
determine whether the fetus is capable of surviving outside the womb.
   _A declaration that ``the life of each human being begins at
conception.''
   The appeals court upheld a provision in the state law that bans
the use of taxpayer money for performing or assisting an abortion.
But it said use of a public facility or the services of a public
employee cannot be banned if all such costs are reimbursed by a
patient.
   In the apppeal acted on today, Missouri Attorney General William
L. Webster said the 8th Circuit court's ruling ``expands (Supreme
Court) precedents in favor of abortion on demand, further contracts
the state's compelling interest in the life of viable, unborn
children and disregards this court's holdings that abortion is a
private matter which government need in no way subsidize.''
   The 1973 decision ``should itself be reconsidered'' if it cannot
be squared with the disputed Missouri law, Webster said.
   William Bradford Reynolds, then chief of the Justice Department's
civil rights division, wrote to Missouri officials last summer
urging them to include a challenge of Roe vs. Wade in the state's
appeal.
   ``I felt this was the best case on the horizon to undertake
reconsideration of Roe,'' Reynolds told The Wall Street Journal in a
recent interview.
   In a brief filed two days after the presidential election ast
Nov. 8, Justice Department lawyers supported Missouri's appeal.
   That sparked Molly Yard, president of the National Organization
for Women, to accuse the Justice Department of ``declaring war on
the women of this country.''
   Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority,
said there will be ``no honeymoon on the issue of abortion'' for
President-elect Bush because of the Justice Department's involvement
in the Missouri case.
   In its 1973 ruling, the Supreme Court said women have a
constitutional right of abortion, based on the right of privacy. The
court most recently reaffirmed that ruling in 1983.
   Today's court is viewed as deeply divided on the abortion issue.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun told a law school audience last
September that the 1973 decision he authored could be overturned in
the court's 1988-89 term.
   ``The next question is, `Will Roe vs. Wade go down the drain?' I
think there's a very distinct possibility that it will _ this term.
You can count the votes,'' he said.
   While Blackmun and Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall
and John Paul Stevens have resisted attempts to reverse or greatly
modify the 1973 decision, anti-abortion forces are hoping some day
to attract five votes for such a result.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Byron R. White
dissented from the 1973 ruling and several subsequent abortion
decisions.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in past decisions has questioned the
court's reasoning in its 1973 decision.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, who has not yet voted in an abortion
decision since being named to the high court by President Reagan in
1986, is thought to favor overturning or curtailing Roe vs. Wade.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court last Feb. 18,
likewise has not voted in an abortion decision. His views on
abortion and the Roe vs. Wade decision are not known in any
significant detail.
   In other action today, the court:
   _ Agreed to decide whether Congress may outlaw all sexually
explicit telephone dial-up message services, dubbed ``dial-a-porn.''
   The justices will judge, sometime by July, the validity of a 1988
law that sought to ban all obscene and indecent messages available
through dial-a-porn services.
   _ Allowed criminal defendants to exclude potential jurors because
of their race.
   In a case involving a black man's murder by Ku Klux Klan members,
rejected arguments by Alabama prosecutors _ supported by law
enforcement officials nationwide _ that defense lawyers unlawfully
are seeking to impanel an all-white jury in the Klan case.
   _ Refused to review lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in
damages in behalf of children with birth defects allegedly caused by
the anti-nausea drug Bendectin.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by more than 800
families who sued Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, the maker of
Bendectin, in federal court in Ohio.
   _ Let stand a contempt citation against a mother jailed since
August 1987 for refusing to disclose the whereabouts of her
daughter, whom she says was sexually abused by the child's father.
   The justices, without comment, let stand the contempt citation
against Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, a District of Columbia plastic surgeon.
   _ Barred local governments from receiving $180 million in federal
revenue sharing funds withheld by the Reagan administration.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that the money
properly was withheld under budget cuts imposed by the so-called
Gramm-Rudman Act.
   _ Turned away arguments that judges violate free-speech rights
when keeping secret the names of people selected as grand jury
members.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a Missouri judge's
decision to bar public inspection of the names of grand jurors in a
double-murder investigation.
   The abortion case is Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services,
88-605.

<HEAD>President Described As Recovering Nicely From Surgery</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: Top 3 grafs UPDATE with White House comment on Reagan condition;
Picks up 3rd graf pvs, ``The president''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan is ``recovering quite well''
from successful surgery to correct a curvature of his left ring
finger, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today.
   ``He was making jokes about it,'' Fitzwater told reporters at his
daily news briefing. ``The bandage will become progressively smaller
in the next few days,'' although Reagan will wear a support splint
for several months.
   Reagan returned to the White House from Walter Reed Army Medical
Center on Sunday, a day after undergoing nearly three hours of
surgery under local anesthesia.
   The president, accompanied by first lady Nancy Reagan, lifted his
left hand, with a bulky bandage on it, as he stepped out of the
emergency entrance of the hospital in Northwest Washington.
   Asked how he felt, he replied, ``Fine,'' in a vigorous, booming
voice. After raising his bandaged left hand, he waved with his right.
   The operation was to alleviate a worsening condition known as
Dupuytren's contracture, which caused the president's fingers to
curve inward in a claw-like configuration.
   Dr. John Hutton, the White House physician, said last week the
operation would not interfere with the president's performance of
his duties.
   In a statement after the operation on Saturday, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater described the surgery as ``successfully
completed.''
   Since recovery normally takes two to three weeks, the president
may still be wearing the bandage when he turns over the reins of
government to President-elect Bush at inauguration ceremonies on
Jan. 20.

<NOTE>Improved Management</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   In 1981, I made a promise to the American people ``to limit
government to its proper role and make it the servant, not the
master, of the people.''
   My ``Management Improvement Program: Reform '88'' has helped make
government more efficient and more responsive.
   We reduced waste and fraud in federal programs by combining the
efforts of the inspectors general into the President's Council on
Integrity and Efficiency, resulting in over $110 billion saved or
put to better use _ and their efforts are continuing.
   I saw that the federal government did not have effective cash
management practices for dealing with what is now a $2 trillion
annual cash flow, nor did it have a governmentwide credit management
program for what is now a $1 trillion portfolio.
   This resulted in the waste of billions of dollars each year.
   We built the necessary governmentwide controls in both areas and
stopped the drain.
   Moreover, we began the establishment of the first governmentwide
financial accounting system, consolidating and making uniform over
400 previously incompatible individual agency systems.
   This was essential for any well-managed government, and is
presently being implemented.
   The federal government has a major effect on our daily lives
through the collection of taxes and fees, the direct provisions of
services, the payment of financial assistance through various
entitlement programs, and the regulation of commercial enterprises.
   Through modernization, improved administration, and automated
services the government has made substantial reductions in the time
it takes to provide services to the public.
   As the 21st century approaches, the federal government must adapt
its role in our society to changing conditions and changing
technology.
   At the turn of the century, the U.S. population will exceed 268
million, with a larger proportion of elderly citizens.
   Changes in technology and communication will increasingly link
the world's economies, trade, capital flows, and travel as never
before.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Bankruptcy Issue in Connecticut Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether states generally are immune from being sued for money
damages by bankruptcy trustees.
   The court said it will use two cases of bankrupt businesses in
Connecticut to determine whether states, and possibly the federal
government also, enjoy such immunity.
   The justices will hear an appeal by Martin W. Hoffman, a
court-appointed trustee supervising payment to creditors of
Willington Convalescent Home Inc. and Edward Zera, who ran a
maintenance service.
   The nursing home, which shut down in April 1983, said Connecticut
officials owed it $64,010 in Medicaid payments for patients treated
at the home.
   Zera, who declared bankruptcy in 1983, sought to recover $2,100
in taxes paid to Connecticut.
   Hoffman invoked federal bankruptcy law to recover the money in
behalf of the nursing home and Zera and use it to help pay their
creditors.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last June that the
immunity from money damages states generally enjoy extends to
federal bankruptcy law.
   The Reagan administration said it agrees with the 2nd Circuit
court ruling, but urged the Supreme Court to hear arguments in the
case because other federal appeals courts have taken an opposite
view.
   Such disputes arise frequently and the conflict should be
resolved by the high court, the Justice Department said.
   The department said the reasoning of the 2nd Circuit court
appears to apply to federal agencies as well as to states.
   The Supreme Court is expected to announce a decision by July.
   The case is Hoffman vs. Connecticut, 88-412.

20-year-old man gunned down as he rode with a teen-ager on a
bicycle, authorities said today.
   Danny Perez and a 16-year-old boy were taken to County-USC
Medical Center after a shooting in East Los Angeles on Friday
evening, sheriff's Deputy Chris Wahla said today.
   Perez was pronounced dead at the hospital. The 16-year-old's

   Meanwhile, Irvin Smith, 36, was killed and another unidentified
man was injured when they were hit by a hail of gunfire late
Saturday, said Lt. Frank Valdez. He said the shooting was
narcotics-related.
   In Compton on Friday, 23-year-old David Berkley was shot and
killed in what was believed to be a gang-related attack, said police
Lt. Gary Anderson.
   Compton police were also investigating possible gang links to two
separate shootings, one of them a drive-by attack at 10:30 p.m.
Sunday in which two men and a woman were injured, said Anderson.
   The men were in critical condition and the woman was in good
condition at Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical Center, Anderson
said. They were not identified.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling in Maryland Foster Care Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling that
expands the right of allegedly abused or mistreated foster children
to sue their social workers.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that workers may
be sued for damages under a key federal civil rights law by foster
children in federally funded programs.
   The court rejected an appeal by Maryland social service employees
seeking greater legal protection.
   The Reagan administration joined in urging the court to review a
ruling by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Justice Department
lawyers said the appeals court ruling would expose thousands of
state and local social welfare workers to personal financial
liability for injuries suffered by children in foster homes.
   The government said the appeals court ruling could have even more
far-reaching impact if it is extended to apply to other federally
funded social welfare programs.
   State and local workers who administer Aid for Dependent
Children, Medicaid and food stamp programs also could be exposed to
the risk of big-money damages, the government said.
   The Maryland case stems from a suit against 21 officials,
caseworkers and supervisors who help administer the state's
federally funded foster care program in Baltimore.
   They were sued by children who say they were victims of physical
and sexual abuse and medical neglect.
   A federal judge ordered officials to submit a plan for improving
conditions in foster homes, and for at least monthly monitoring of
the placement of children in the homes.
   The judge also required the officials to improve medical services
for foster children and to report instances of poor medical care to
the children's attorneys.
   The judge also ruled that social workers who place or keep
children in foster homes are not entitled to immunity from lawsuits
in such cases.
   The 4th Circuit court upheld the decision in February 1988.
   The appeals court rejected the social workers' claims that a
federal law providing funds for foster care created no duty on their
part to know whether a child would be exposed to mistreatment or
abuse.
   The appeals court said the social workers' right to claim
immunity from suit must be based on more than their own belief that
they acted properly. It is up to a trial court examining the facts
to decide whether the social workers permitted mistreatment, the
appeals court said.
   The National Association of Social Workers, in supporting the
appeal by the Maryland employees, said the 4th Circuit court ruling
places social workers at risk for alleged abuses that occurred
decades earlier.
   ``No professional consensus exists even now'' on how to assure
foster children will not be harmed, the association said.
``Maltreatment of children in foster homes often is difficult, and
at times impossible, to prevent by even a very highly skilled and
well-trained social worker.''
   The Supreme Court already is studying a related issue in the case
of a Wisconsin boy who suffered severe beatings by his father.
   In that case, the justices are expected to decide whether public
officials may be sued when their alleged gross negligence permits a
child to be abused by a parent.
   Social workers were accused of failing to come to the aid of the
boy even after they had evidence that he was beaten repeatedly.
   The case acted on today focuses on whether a federal civil rights
law enacted after the Civil War permits damage suits based on
alleged violations of a 1980 law, the Adoption Assistance and Child
Welfare Act.
   The 1980 law requires states to meet certain conditions before
receiving federal funds for foster care. The 4th Circuit court said
the 1980 law creates a basis for private citizens to sue if those
conditions allegedly are not met.
   The case is Massinga vs. L.J., 87-1796.

<HEAD>Pentagon Spending Increases 2 Percent Above Inflation</HEAD>

6-8, picking up: The proposed ....</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci is asking
Congress to increase defense spending by 2 percent above the rate of
inflation for the next two years in a proposed military budget
likely to change after George Bush becomes president.
   In proposing $315.2 billion in budget authority for 1990, and
$330.89 billion for 1991, Carlucci is requesting an increase in Star
Wars spending authority from $4.1 billion in 1989 to $5.9 billion in
1990 and $7 billion in 1991.
   Under the proposed defense budget for the fiscal year beginning
next Oct. 1, although $315.2 billion would be authorized, $303
billion would actually be spent. The spending authority includes
funding for long-term projects and weapons buying in future years.
The lower figure, outlays, includes only the funds to be spent
during the 12 months of the 1990 fiscal year.
   The $303 billion in 1990 outlays includes Pentagon spending and
$9.2 billion for Energy Department nuclear weapons and research
programs, and is projected at $4.7 billion above actual spending
during this fiscal year.
   Among the requests likely to be changed by Congress or Bush are
$94.6 million in spending authority in 1990 and $124.3 million the
next year for research on a new Navy Anti-Satellite (ASAT) weapon;
and elimination of a proposed single-warhead intercontinental
ballistic missile, the Midgetman.
   In other areas of national security, the Reagan administration is
asking for an increase of $5.6 billion, to a level of $8.4 billion,
in security assistance programs to other nations. The whopping 200
percent jump comes in part because loan repayments from other
nations go down next year.
   The administration is asking for $3.8 billion for grants to
foreign countries _ mostly in the Middle East _ so they can buy U.S.
weapons.
   Another $3.5 billion is being sought in non-military aid, mostly
for Central America and the Middle East. The budget message
forecasts the request of additional money for the Contra guerrillas
of Nicaragua.
   The proposed Pentagon budget also continues production of the
newly unveiled B-2 or stealth bomber, designed to elude enemy radar.
The exact annual cost of that program remains classified, although
the Air Force announced Dec. 16 that each B-2 would cost $516
million, a total of $68.1 billion for 132 planes by 1995, making it
the most expensive plane in the world.
   The B-2 program may face trouble following disclosures of
inadequacies in electronic equipment designed to enable newly
acquired B-1B bombers to penetrate enemy defenses.
   It is also far from clear whether Bush and Congress will agree to
cancel the Midgetman, which would be designed to be fired from
mobile trucks. Last year, the Air Force volunteered to drop the
Midgetman in favor of a rail-mobile version of the 10-warhead MX, or
Peacekeeper.
   The Air Force argued that 500 warheads could be deployed on 50
Peacekeepers for $10 billion vs. $44.7 billion for the Midgetman.
   But Congress restored money for research on Midgetman, arguing
that more missiles would be harder to track and destroy, and that a
single-warhead weapon made more sense under a proposed Strategic
Arms Limitation Treaty limiting the number of launchers.
   Bush was expected to submit a revised version of the budget, and
the retired Air Force general he has named as national security
adviser, Brent Scowcroft, has publicly endorsed the Midgetman over
the MX and has suggested lower levels of funding for Star Wars,
formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   The active duty strength of the armed forces would increase by
5,000 in 1990 to a level of 2,138,300, then decrease the following
year to 2,134,600.
   The force level in the Army and Marine Corps remain the same, at
772,000 for the Army and 197,000 for the Marines, that of the Air
Force would decline slightly, from 571,000 in 1989 and 1990 to
567,000 in 1991, and that of the Navy would grow from 593,000 to
598,000 to provide crews for the addition of new aircraft carriers
to the current fleet of 13 flattops.
   The Navy must postpone its plans for a 600-ship fleet, although
Adm. Stephen Loftus told reporters that goal could be achieved
sometime in the 1990s. The number of ships would drop to 574 next
year and 571 in 1991 with retirements that include two ballistic
missiles submarines and the conversion of another into a moored
training ship in 1990.
   One submarine armed with Trident class ballistic missiles is to
be added each year, with 63 Trident II missiles delivered in 1990
and 52 in 1991.
   The Navy, as expected, will acquire two SSN-688 nuclear attack
submarines in 1990 and two SSN-21 Seawolf nuclear attack submarines
in 1991.
   The budget calls for pay raises of 3.6 percent in 1990 and 3.2
percent in 1991 for uniformed military and of 2 percent and 3
percent for civilian employees of the Defense Department.
   As the number of men and women in active service declines, the
number in the National Guard and reserves is to increase by 7,600 to
1,178,300 in fiscal 1990 and to 1,181,700 the following year.

<TEXT>
   A mild earthquake shook the Las Vegas
area, cracking some windows and rattling nerves, but authorities
received no reports of serious damage or injury.
   ``My kid came in the living room screaming that his bed was
moving,'' said Adam Churchin, who lives four miles southeast of
downtown Las Vegas. ``It scared the living daylights out of him.''
   The temblor, centered 10 miles northeast of Las Vegas, struck at
9:08 p.m. Sunday and measured between 3.2 and 3.5 on the Richter
scale, according to seismologists at the U.S. Geological Survey
offices in Menlo Park, Calif., and Boulder, Colo.
   Earlier Sunday, the Alaksa Tsunami Warning Center reported two
moderate earthquakes in an area southeast of Adak in the Aleutian
Islands. The quakes registered 5.6 and 4.8 on the Richter scale, but
neither was felt at Adak, the nearest populated area.
   The Las Vegas quake was felt most strongly in suburban North Las
Vegas, where a Police Department switchboard operator reported
receiving at least 500 telephone calls from worried citizens.
   Some callers, including Municipal Court Judge Gary Davis,

property damage or injuries, according to the operator, who declined
to identify herself.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude, or the height of quake-generated shock waves recorded
on a seismograph.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area.

   Extradition proceedings for a man
accused of killing two McDonald's restaurant employees and then
arrested in Delaware will begin this week, police said.
   Robert P. Hughes IV, 21, of the suburban Philadelphia community
of Glen Mills, is charged with the two shooting deaths Sunday
morning, officials said.
   Restaurant manager Jean Reider, 41, of Newark, Del., and Charles
Hegarty, 46, of West Chester, were killed in the holdup, which
occurred before the restaurant had opened, police said.
   Hughes was arrested at the bus terminal in Wilmington, Del.,
several hours later, according to Wilmington police Sgt. Richard
Andress. He was charged with resisting arrest, carrying a concealed
deadly weapon and held as a fugitive, Andress said.
   In Pennsylvania, Hughes was charged with two counts of murder,
two counts of criminal homicide, robbery and weapons violations,
said James P. MacElree II, Chester County district attorney.

<HEAD>1990 Budget Highlights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here, at a glance, are the highlights of
President Reagan's proposed federal budget for the 1990 fiscal year,
beginning next Oct. 1.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>SUMMARY</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Reagan's farewell budget proposes collecting $1.059 trillion in
revenues and spending $1.152 trillion.
   That leaves a deficit of $92.5 billion, the lowest since a $73.7
billion imbalance between spending and revenues in 1981.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>FEES AND TAXES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   While proposing no new taxes, the budget seeks $1 billion in a
variety of user fees, ranging from a new $25 decal for boat owners
to higher charges for getting government-backed loans, including VA
mortgages.
   The president called for a $1.7 billion tax cut for corporations
with foreign operations and recommended changes that would save the
oil and gas industries about $39 million.
   Reagan urged repeal of a law requiring that taxes on airplane
tickets, shippers and fuel be cut in half next Jan. 1, a move which
would cost shippers and travelers $1.2 billion.
   He would also require all state and local government workers to
pay the tax that funds Medicare. Those hired before April 1, 1986,
are not paying, even though most are eligible for Medicare because
of earlier, non-government employment or through their spouses. This
would raise $2 billion.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>HEALTH AND SOCIAL</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The budget proposes trimming Medicare, which provides health care
to Social Security recipients, by $3.2 billion below the projected
increase for 1990, primarily by reducing the fees received by
doctors and hospitals.
   Medicaid, which pays the health bills of poor people, would be
cut by $1.7 billion over its projected increase for 1990 with the
savings coming from reductions in federal payments to the states,
which run the Medicaid program.
   An increase of 24 percent to $1.6 billion is proposed in the
search for a cure for AIDS.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>DEFENSE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   There would be $303 billion in defense outlays, including
Pentagon spending and $9.2 billion for Energy Department nuclear
weapons and research programs. That is $4.7 billion above spending
during this fiscal year.
   Among the requests are funding for research on a new Navy
Anti-Satellite weapon; and elimination of a proposed single-warhead
intercontinental ballistic missile, the Midgetman.
   The Pentagon budget continues production of the new B-2 or
stealth bomber and seeks an increase in spending on development of
the space-based Star Wars nuclear defense shield.
   The president also proposes making a downpayment of $900 million
to start cleaning up and modernizing the government's aging nuclear
weapons facilities.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PROGRAM TERMINATIONS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The proposal calls for termination of 82 individual programs
including the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Legal Services
Corporation, the Economic Development Administration, the
Appalachian Regional Commission, direct loans by the Small Business
Administration, Amtrak railroad passenger subsidies, mass transit
grants and subsidies to airlines serving small airports.
   Reagan proposed the sale of about $6 billion in government
assets, including the two naval petroleum reserves and various
government loans held by the public.
   Reagan has tried and failed over the years to get Congress to go
along with these proposals.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>AGRICULTURE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Spending on farm programs would be cut by $9.7 billion, a 19
percent reduction, achieved in part with cuts in subsidy payments to
farmers.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>FEDERAL PAY</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The budget includes $380 million to pay for the controversial 50
percent pay hike for members of Congress, federal judges and other
top federal officials. But Reagan proposed pay increases of only 2
percent for civilian employees and 3.6 percent for the military.
   He recommended skipping the annual cost-of-living increase for
federal civilian and military retirees in January 1990, to save $1.4
billion, and he proposed holding increases after that time to 1
percentage point below the inflation rate.

   The 1990 Management Report, which is being forwarded to the

highlights of OMB's report to me on ``Government of the Future.''
   That Management Report has been expanded as a beginning to a

budget and should become a part of the annual budget process.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUDGET PROCESS REFORM IS DESPERATELY NEEDED TO CONTINUE DEFICIT REDUCTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The persistence of the budget deficit is overwhelming evidence
that the federal budget process is fundamentally flawed.
   Past efforts at ``reform'' have been directed largely toward
protecting a large portion of domestic spending from real fiscal
discipline.
   Fourteen years after passage of the Congressional Budget Act and
three years after enactment of the Balanced Budget and Emergency
Deficit Control Act, the federal budget process remains unwieldy and
undisciplined.
   The American people expect better of their political system, and
they deserve it.
   Under the Congressional Budget Act, congressional budget
resolutions _ Congress' proposed budgets _ are passed each year.
   They are not sent to the president for approval and, therefore,
are not law.
   They provide guidance to the committees of Congress, but the
guidance is often late and ambiguous.
   The resolutions are usually passed well after the dates required
by law, and well after they are needed by the finance, authorizing,
and appropriations committees.
   Moreover, there is little agreement within Congress on the
guidance provided.
   The House of Representatives and the Senate do not agree, except
in the most general terms, on the priorities implied by resolutions
both have approved.
   Except for last year's on-time performance, Congress'
self-imposed budget deadlines have usually been missed, and massive
continuing resolutions and reconciliation bills have been the rule
rather than the exception.
   These large, cumbersome bills provide cozy hiding places for
hundreds of special interest add-ons, which line-item veto authority
would permit the president to challenge.
   A number of changes in the budget process _ most of which I have
recommended before _ are needed to instill budget discipline
throughout the legislative process.
   I urge Congress to adopt the following measures:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Balanced budget amendment</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ I remain committed to and urge approval of a constitutional
amendment requiring a balanced budget.
   The amendment should require a supermajority vote (at least 60
percent) in the Congress to increases taxes.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Line-item veto</HEAD>
<TEXT>
    _ My successors should be given the authority, subject to
congressional override, to veto line-items in annual appropriations
bills, in authorizing legislation that provides or mandates funding
for programs, and in revenue bills.
   Such authority would permit the elimination of substantial waste
and would be an effective instrument for enforcing budget
discipline.

<HEAD>WASHN: budget discipline.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Enhanced rescission authority</HEAD>
<TEXT>
    _To enhance the president's ability to control government
spending, I recommend that line-item veto authority be complemented
by a change in law that would require the Congress to vote ``yea''
or ``nay'' on any rescission proposed by the president.
   Current law allows the Congress to duck responsibility by simply
ignoring proposed rescissions for 45 days.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Biennial budgeting</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ The annual budget process consumes too much time and energy.
   A biennial budget would reduce the repetitive budget tasks, allow
more time for considering key spending and revenue decisions,
provide less scope for gimmicks that give the illusion of
``savings,'' such as shifting spending from one year to another
without affecting the underlying programs, and permit the
realization of real savings that would be possible with a more
assured availability of funds.
   For these reasons, I recommend that biennial budgeting be
adopted.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Joint budget resolution</HEAD>
<TEXT>
    _To ensure the broader scrutiny and stricter discipline that is
needed in the congressional budget process, I propose that Congress
be required to prepare a budget resolution covering a minimum of two
years showing revenue proposals individually and showing spending
priorities.
   The Congress should also be required to submit its budget
resolution to the president for his signature or veto.
   Subsequent legislation which exceeds these allocations should not
be considered without supermajority approval.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Individual transmittal of appropriations bills</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ The practice of transmitting full-year continuing resolutions
covering a number of appropriations bills does not permit the
legislative and executive branches to exercise proper scrutiny of
those bills.
   Too often in the past, such continuing resolutions have provided
convenient cover for special-interest spending that would not
survive close scrutiny.
   To minimize this risk, I propose that appropriations bills be
transmitted individually to the president.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Credit reform</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _ The effects of credit activities are recorded imperfectly under
current budget accounting.
   The subsidy component of federal lending programs remains hidden.
   To correct this major fault in the budget system, I recommended
credit reform legislation two years ago.
   This legislation, which I am recommending again, would measure
the true cost _ the present value _ of the subsidies provided by
federal credit programs and put that cost on an expenditure basis
equivalent to the cost of other federal programs.
   This change must be an integral part of the reform of the budget
process.

<HEAD>Court to Rule on Double Jeopardy in Missouri Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to use the case
of a convicted murderer from Missouri to study double-jeopardy
protection for criminal defendants.
   The court agreed to hear arguments by state officials seeking to
reinstate a life prison sentence for Larry P. Thomas.
   Thomas was convicted of murder and attempted robbery in an
attempted holdup of an auto parts store in St. Louis on Nov. 8, 1972.
   Mentoe Vernell, a customer at the store, died in a shootout with
Thomas.
   Thomas was sentenced to 15 years in prison for attempted robbery
and a life term for murder.
   Then-Gov. Christopher Bond of Missouri commuted the robbery
sentence in 1981 after Thomas had served about eight years. He
remained in prison on the murder conviction.
   A state court subsequently threw out the sentence for attempted
robbery and credited the time Thomas had served for that crime to
the murder sentence. The state courts said he must continue serving
the life sentence.
   Thomas then appealed in federal court to have the murder sentence
thrown out.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 5-4 ruling last
April, ruled that Thomas' right against double jeopardy was violated
because he was given multiple sentences for the same crime. The
governor's commutation means that Thomas legally had served one of
his sentences and must be set free, the appeals court said.
   ``We hold that Thomas had legally satisfied the 15-year sentence
for the attempted robbery and that his continued confinement for the
felony murder offense violated his double jeopardy rights,'' the
appeals court said.
   State officials, in appealing to the Supreme Court, said the
appeals court exceeded its authority and misinterpreted Missouri law.
   The state attorney general's office said the state courts
``cured'' the double jeopardy violation when it threw out the
sentence for attempted robbery and gave Thomas credit for time
served.
   The case is Jones vs. Thomas, 88-420.

<HEAD>Court to Study New York Challenge to Magistrates' Authority</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether federal magistrates are constitutionally authorized to
preside over jury selection when delegated such duty by federal
trial judges.
   The court said it will study the case of two men convicted in
federal court in New York City of possessing cocaine with intent to
distribute it.
   Jose Gomez and Diego Chavez-Tesina say their convictions were
tainted because the judge who presided over their trial assigned the
task of jury selection to a federal magistrate.
   Their appeals argue that such a delegation of authority violates
that part of the Constitution bestowing judicial power.
   Gomez was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 10 years parole.
Chavez-Tesina was sentenced to 20 years in prison and a lifetime
parole.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the two men's
convictions last June 1.
   The appeals court said the Federal Magistrates Act authorizes
such delegation of power for the jury-selection portions of trials,
and that the federal law does not violate the Constitution.
   Gomez and Chavez-Tesina had argued that magistrates only could be
assigned pretrial duties.
   Justice Department lawyers urged the high court to use the case
to resolve conflicting rulings on magistrates' authority between the
2nd Circuit court and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based
in New Orleans.
   According to court documents, Gomez is now an inmate at a federal
prison in Ashland, Ky., and Chavez-Tesina is imprisoned in Milan,
Mich.
   The cases are Gomez vs. U.S., 88-5014, and Chavez-Tesina vs.
U.S., 88-5158.

<HEAD>Judge Issues Restraining Order On INS Policy</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 13 grafs to UPDATE with judge issuing restraining
order against INS policy, another hearing set for Thursday. Picks up 10th
graf, `In essence...'.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge this morning issued a
temporary restraining order blocking a 3-week-old immigration
service rule that opponents say has left hundreds of Central
Americans living in tents and shanties in the lower Rio Grande
Valley.
   ``One would be blind not to recognize that we have a problem,''
said U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela, upon issuing the order sought
by attorneys fighting the rule.
   Vela set a hearing for 9 a.m. Thursday, when he said he would
consider converting the restraining order into an injunction against
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   Attorney David Ayala, representing the INS, had asked the judge
instead to delay considering the restraining order until Thursday to
give the government a chance to prepare further arguments.
   ``Your honor, the Immigration Service is not to blame for the
plight of the people who are out there,'' Ayala said.
   The judge's restraining order restores the right of asylum
seekers to travel farther into the United States and submit their
applications in the INS districts where they intend to live.
   Hundreds of Central American asylum seekers have set up camp in
the Rio Grande Valley to await the processing of their applications.
Some 300 applicants camping in a field near Brownsville have been
ordered to leave the primitive tent city by this afternoon because
it's private property.
   Today's ruling doesn't affect the property owner's order, except
that the 300 persons in the tent city would be free now to go to
another part of the United States.
   The 300 have been sleeping under sheets of plastic supported by
tree limbs for the past week in a field across the street from the
Casa Oscar Romero shelter for Central American refugees operated by
the Roman Catholic Church, which is filled to capacity.
   The INS policy, which was effective Dec. 16, also had limited the
aliens' ability to work during the waiting period while their asylum
applications were processed, at least 30 days.
   Previously, aliens who entered the country illegally in southern
Texas were allowed to pursue their asylum applications in other
cities, often Miami or Los Angeles.
   INS officials say the change was adopted to reduce huge case
backlogs in those cities and curb frivolous refugee claims. The INS
maintains that most of the 300,000 asylum applicants who passed
through the Harlingen District last year were ineligible for
political asylum because they merely wanted to better themselves
economically.
   The attorneys suing INS Commissioner Alan Nelson and U.S.
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh blame the 3-week-old procedure for
an increase in the number of Central Americans sleeping in condemned
buildings and camping with little or no shelter. Their federal
lawsuit was filed Friday.
   ``In essence, south Texas has been turned into a de facto
detention area and asylum applicants are trapped there,'' says the
suit filed on behalf of asylum-seekers by immigration attorney Linda
Reyna Yanez, Robert Rubin of the San Francisco Lawyers' Committee
for Urban Affairs and the Harlingen-based Proyecto Libertad
immigrant advocacy group.
   It accuses the INS of depriving immigrants of adequate access to
the asylum procedure as required by the Refugee Act of 1980, and of
implementing a policy change without publishing it in the Federal
Register for public comment.
   INS officials have declined comment on the lawsuit.
   Legal officer Susan Timberlake with the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees visited the tent city southeast of
Brownsville last Tuesday and said she witnessed ``difficulty and
hardship.''
   On Sunday, sheriff's deputies told those living on the
litter-strewn campsite that they had 24 hours to vacate the private
property or face trespassing charges.
   Cameron County Sheriff Alex Perez said authorities gave the order
to vacate after the property owner posted ``No Trespassing'' signs
in English and Spanish on Sunday afternoon.
   ``Maybe I'll sleep in some other field,'' said Gerardo Enrique
Perez, 19, of Honduras, as a rainy cold front blew into the area
Sunday night.
   The campers have been helped by area residents who have provide
food and clothing, but the field has no sanitary facilities.
   But some nearby residents said the growing campground made them
nervous.
   ``You don't know who these people are,'' said Alma Zieger,
manager of Paul's RV Park, who said the situation ``creates
uneasiness'' among the retirees making up the bulk of her tenants.

   _Budget discipline and lasting deficit reduction would be

</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONCLUSION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The accomplishments of the American people in the past eight
years will always be for me a source of pride.
   However, we must continue our recent progress in reducing the
federal deficit.
   Deficit reduction is a key national priority, written into law by
the G-R-H Act, which, despite its defects, legislated a process to
achieve a balanced budget.
   This budget achieves the 1990 target of the amended act, and
projects a budget balance in 1993.
   It preserves legitimate programs for the aged and needy, provides
for adequate national security, devotes more resources to other
high-priority activities, and accomplishes all this without raising
taxes.
   Tax increases are not needed.
   History shows that they would simply be used by the Congress to
increase spending.
   Tax increases have been overwhelmingly voted down in the last
three presidential elections.
   I call upon the Congress to enact this budget.
   Higher taxes are not needed _ as this budget demonstrates _ but
genuine deficit reduction through moderating the growth in spending
is essential to enable the next administration and Congress to
address the nation's agenda for the future.
   Over the past eight years, we Americans have made our world a
safer place for freedom because we had the will to reinvigorate our
economy, rebuild our defenses, and provide for the less fortunate
among us.
   Together, we achieved a new beginning for our country and
prepared the way for the next administration to build on our
accomplishments.

   An airplane on a military test flight
crashed minutes after takeoff from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
this morning, killing both occupants, a base spokeswoman said.
   An Air Force pilot and a civilian were aboard the two-seat XX-300
twin-engine plane owned by Jaffe Corp. of San Antonio, Texas, said
Wright-Patterson spokeswoman Kathy Higgins.
   Ms. Higgins said the civilian in the plane was a representative
of Jaffe, the plane's manufacturer.
   Neither the Air Force nor the State Highway Patrol, which was
investigating the crash, knew which victim was flying the aircraft.
Names of the dead were not immediately released pending notification
of relatives, Ms. Higgins said.
   The turbo-prop plane was being demonstrated to officials at
Wright-Patterson as a possible replacement for the T-37, which the
Air Force plans to replace as its primary training vehicle.
   The plane departed from Wright-Patterson about 8:55 a.m. and
disappeared from base radar screens nine minutes later, Ms. Higgins
said. The wreckage was found in a rural area in northwestern Clinton
County, about 17 miles southwest of Wright-Patterson.

<TEXT>
   Both engines on a brand-new Boeing 737
apparently failed before the plane crashed along a highway, killing
46 people, officials said today. Aviation experts said the chances
of double-engine failure were about 10 million to one.
   ``So far the evidence, although by no means conclusive, is
consistent with the right engine having stopped before impact and
there are also signs of fire in the left engine,'' Transport
Minister Paul Channon said in an interview on British Broadcasting
Corp. television.
   Olivier Fagard, a spokesman for the company that makes the CFM-56
engines the jet used, told The Associated Press, ``It is extremely
improbable that both motors would break down in such a short
interval.''
   ``We have very impressive reliability statistics,'' said Fagard,
of the French company SNECMA, which builds the engines in consortium
with General Electric Co. ```We don't know. It has been established
that there was no fire in second motor. But we don't know any more
than that,'' he said.
   Officials raised the number of confirmed dead to 46 late today.
Eighty people were injured.
   Investigators recovered the flight recorders from the wreckage,
and firefighters pumped foam onto the crumpled jet to prevent
seeping aviation fuel from catching fire.
   The Belfast-bound British Midland Airways jet carrying 126 people
broke into three pieces on the edge of Britain's main north-south
highway, the M1, in central England on Sunday night.
   The twin-engine Boeing 737-400 narrowly missed the town of
Kegworth and plowed into an embankment a few hundred yards short of
the runway as the pilot struggled to make an emergency landing at
East Midland Airport, 100 miles north of London.
   Ham radio operator Mervyn Solloway said he heard ``not a shouted
message, but a bit of a frantic one to say, `We've got problems with
the other engine.' That was the last I heard from the aircraft.''
   British Midland Airways said sabotage was not suspected in the
crash, which came less than three weeks after a bomb blew apart Pan
Am Flight 103 over the Scottish village of Lockerbie, killing all
259 people on board and 11 on the ground.
   But Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who flew to the scene and
visited survivors at Derby Hospital, said: ``We rule out nothing, we
simply can't. There will be a lot of speculation, but until we have
the facts it is unsafe for me to speculate.''
   Asked about terrorism, Channon replied: ``I don't rule out
anything at this stage but there's certainly no evidence of it.''
   William Tench, retired head of Britain's Air Accident
Investigation Board, said the odds against both engines failing on a
Boeing 737 were 10 million to one.
   ``I would look for some inadvertent technical mistake such as
something incorrect being done to the engines during turnaround,
either inadvertently or deliberately,'' Tench said.
   British Midland said the jet was delivered just 12 weeks ago and
had flown less than 500 hours. It grounded its other 737-400 for
inspection.
   Pilot Kevin Hunt, a 25-year veteran, was among the badly injured
cut from the wreckage. The last survivor, a woman, was pulled from a
tangle of metal and crushed seats more than seven hours after the
crash.
   The plane's two giant wings, heavily loaded with fuel, remained
virtually intact. The severed tail section of Flight BD92 loomed
from woodland alongside the highway, surrounded by wreckage from the
severed center and nose sections.
   ``It makes you wonder how anybody walked from it,'' said
Leicestershire county Chief Fire Officer Barry Pearson.
   Survivor John McCrea said passengers were being served dinner
when the plane got into trouble soon after takeoff from London's
Heathrow Airport.
   ``The captain said `prepare for emergency landing' or something
to that effect, so we braced our heads and about five seconds ...
afterward we were down on the ground with a crash,'' McCrea said
from his bed at the Derby Royal Infirmary in nearby Nottingham.
   Belfast lawyer Mary McHugh, 26, another survivor, said: ``I
thought we were all going to get burned alive. I just thought:
`That's it, I'm dead.' I was terrified of burning to death.''
   At least four British Army soldiers serving in the troubled
Northern Ireland province were killed. The Royal Ulster
Constabulary, the Northern Ireland police force, said several of its
officers were on board.
   As East Midland Airport, the airline's home base, reopened today,
55 relatives of the dead and injured were flown in from Belfast.
   The plane took off at 7:52 p.m., and about eight minutes later
the captain reported ``severe vibrations in one of the engines,''
said British Midland Chairman Michael Bishop.
   Hunt reported an engine on fire, then said he had it under
control and asked for clearance for an emergency landing. Witnesses
said the left engine was on fire as the pilot undershot the runway
by about half a mile and crashed at 8:26 p.m.

<TEXT>
   The tobacco industry, in newspaper ads running
around the country Monday, touted a survey indicating three of four
Americans don't support workplace or restaurant smoking bans.
   The industry's counter-initiative through its lobbying
organization, the Tobacco Institute, comes during the week marking
the 25th anniversary of the first of the surgeon generals' reports
to declare smoking a health hazard.
   A spokeswoman for the institute, Brennan Dawson, noted some
anti-smoking groups are pushing for a ``smoke-free'' society. ``To
achieve their purposes,'' she said, ``anti-smokers are turning to
censorship, harassment, punitive taxes and intrusion into personal
and private decision-making.''
   ``The majority of Americans, according to objective polling, do
not support these anti-smoking efforts,'' she said.
   The institute's poll was conducted by the Washington firm of
Hamilton, Frederick &amp; Schneiders, which said it randomly telephoned
1,500 Americans over age 18 between Nov. 23 and Dec. 6, 1988. The
respondents included 1,099 nonsmokers and 401 smokers, the firm said.
   An overwhelming number of those polled indicated they are
satisfied with current levels of smoking restrictions, and opposed
outright bans in the workplace or public areas. The survey has a
margin of error of plus or minus three points.
   Among the findings:
   _Eight of 10 people believe it should be left to employers and
their employees to determine workplace smoking rules without
government interference.
   _About 74 percent believe restaurants should be allowed to offer
smoking and non-smoking sections to customers.
   _Fifty-three percent believe excise taxes _ amounting to about a
third of the price of a pack of cigarettes _ should stay the same
(38 percent) or be reduced (15 percent).
   _Fifty-seven percent believe cigarette advertising restrictions
should remain the same (38 percent) or be lifted entirely (23
percent), as opposed to banning all advertising.
   The institute's newspaper ads declared ``Enough is enough!'' and
said that meant ``enough taxation ... enough legislation ... enough
control ... enough censorship ... enough harassment ... enough
discrimination'' against smokers.

   Joe Weston-Webb heard the jet come low
over his home and instantly thought of Lockerbie. There was a crash,
stunned silence, then screams from passengers trapped inside a web
of smashed seats.
   ``It was horrendous,'' he said. ``It seems a miracle that any one
got out alive ... and I can't believe that it all didn't go up in
flames.''
   The British Midland Airways Boeing 737-400 jet, with 126 people
aboard, crashed beside the main north-south highway in central
England Sunday as it attempted an emergency landing at East Midlands
Airport. Officials said both engines apparently had failed.
   The second air disaster in Britain in less than three weeks sent
a collective shudder through this village of 2,000 on the edge of
the airport as residents remembered the Scottish town of Lockerbie
and the Dec. 21 crash of Pan Am Flight 103.
   All 259 people aboard that Boeing 747 died when a bomb ripped the
plane apart in the air, and 11 people in Lockerbie were killed by
falling wreckage.
   ``We have been very lucky,'' said George Mellors, 46, another
Kegworth resident. ``It could easily have been another Lockerbie.''
   David Harris ran into his garden and watched in horror as the
plane flew 60 feet over his head and crashed nearby, turning the
night sky red.
   ``Thoughts of Lockerbie came into my mind,'' he said. ``The pilot
did well to avoid our built-up area in Kegworth village. It was only
seconds away from hitting the center of the community.''
   Flight 92 from London to Belfast hit an embankment on the side of
the M1 highway about a half-mile from the airport and broke in
pieces. At least 46 people died.
   Rachel Meadows, 19, of Derby, said she saw the plane come down
just yards away as she was driving on the highway.
   ``It seemed to clip the embankment on one side of the motorway
and then just bounce across before it plowed into the trees. There
was an almighty flash but it didn't explode. A lot of cars on the
motorway began to brake hard. I thought it was going to be a massive
pileup but luckily no cars were hit by the plane.''
   Weston-Webb, 50, of nearby Sutton Bonningale, was one of the
first on the scene.
   When he arrived, everthing was silent. ``People started screaming
later,'' he said.
   ``The seats were all slapped on top of each other where they had
gone forward. And the seats had all gone forward toward the cockpit
end and the people had all been shunted together. There were people
in a sort of concertina, you had to take the seats from the back of
the people in front to get them out,'' Weston-Webb said.
   Many seemed to have smashed ankles and legs and facial injuries,
he said.
   Police Inspector Graham Ward said: ``It was a terrible sight.
Everything was done to pull people out as quickly as possible. We
had to flatten trees across fields to get to the plane.''
   More than seven hours after the crash, passengers were still
trapped in the wreckage.
   The Episcopal Rev. Michael Brandon, 32, said prayers for the
victims.
   ``I held one man's hand as he died and I whispered the Lord's
Prayer _ what more can you do?''

   Peter Falk will return to television as
``Columbo'' on Feb. 6, ABC announced Monday.
   Falk made the rumpled detective a household name in the 1970s,
and ABC announced last year that he had signed on for a revival of
the series. The new ``Columbo'' was to have begun in the fall, but
the writers strike delayed production.
   A series of two-hour ``Columbo'' movies will rotate Monday nights
with two other movies: ``B.L. Stryker,'' starring Burt Reynolds as a
Florida private eye, premieres on Feb. 13; and ``Gideon Oliver,''
starring Oscar-winner Louis Gossett Jr. (``An Officer and a
Gentleman'') as a crime-solving anthropologist, makes its debut Feb.
20.
   ABC also announced Monday that it will rebroadcast ``The Day
After,'' the made-for-TV movie about a nuclear war and its
aftermath, on Jan. 23. ``The Day After'' remains the highest-rated
made-for-TV movie ever. When it first aired in January 1983, it had
a rating of 46.0, an estimated 100 million viewers.

   Voters may think it's time that Coleman Young
stepped down as mayor, but they are not ready to replace him with
singer Stevie Wonder, according to a poll published Monday.
   The Detroit Free Press said its survey found Young tied with
Thomas Barrow, his 1985 opponent, but holding substantial leads over
seven other potential rivals, including Wonder, who has expressed
interest in the job.
   Barrow, an accountant and the nephew of boxing great Joe Louis,
led the successful opposition to casino gambling in the city, an
idea long promoted by the mayor.
   The Free Press published the poll in two parts, beginning Sunday
when it reported that Young and Barrow were deadlocked at 42
percent, with 16 percent undecided. The poll of 500 registered
voters had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
   Monday's installment matched Young against other prominent
Detroit figures. He led them all by decisive margins.
   Wonder, who has said he would like to run for mayor but has not
expressed an interest in challenging Young, was the choice of 21
percent to Young's 57 percent.
   On Sunday, both the Free Press and The Detroit News released
surveys indicating that a majority of voters don't think Young, 70,
should run for re-election this year.
   Young, a Democrat first elected in 1973, has not formally
announced his candidacy but has told associates he will seek a fifth
term as mayor of the nation's sixth-largest city, both newspapers
said.

   Transport workers walked off the job to
protest the arrest of six union leaders, and thousands of commuters
across the country were stranded, police said Monday.
   More than 30,000 buses, vans, trucks and other vehicles making up
two-thirds of the nation's public transport system halted services
Sunday, said a police official on condition of anonymity.
   At least 200 people were injured slightly by strikers who threw
stones at buses that did not observe the stoppage, said the official.
   The strike followed the arrests Saturday of union leaders accused
of instigating violence during agitation to demand the shifting of a
bus terminal from a northern suburb of Dhaka to the city center,
according to the official.
   Protesters also demanded an end to what they called forcible
collection of illegal tolls, which they said went to the ruling
Jatiya Party.

   France told the Security Council today that
all parties should show restraint following the U.S. downing of two
Libyan MiGs over the Mediterranean Sea last week.
   ``We hope everyone will exercise restraint and refrain from any
act which could enhance tensions,'' said French envoy Pierre
Brochand, the deputy permanent representative.
   Brochand spoke at an emergency session convened to discuss
Libya's demand that the United States be condemned for shooting down
the planes Wednesday.
   The United States said the planes were armed and dangerous. Libya
said they were unarmed and on a reconnaissance mission.
   France, the first U.S. ally to speak in the debate, did not
support or criticize either side and is expected to abstain when the
Security Council votes on the issue, probably Wednesday.
   Also speaking today were Finland, Ethiopia, Senegal, Sudan,
India, Morocco and Bangladesh. The session then adjourned until
Tuesday, when a resolution was expected to be submitted.
   Except for France, major U.S. allies like Britain have not spoken
and virtually all speakers have denounced or criticized the U.S.
action.
   ``France deeply regrets the incident between Libyan and U.S. air
forces,'' Brochand said. ``Our country, which borders the
Mediterranean, is particularly concerned about the maintenance of
stability and peace in that region.''
   Finnish Ambassador Klaus Tornudd also urged restraint. He noted
that Libya said its aircraft were on routine reconnaissance and the
United States said its planes were on a routine training mission.
   ``There must be something wrong with the routines if this is the
result,'' he said.
   He said there was a need for an international code of conduct
covering international naval forces and aircraft.
   On Friday, U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters exhibited two
enlarged photographs that he said proved the Libyan warplanes were
armed with missiles. Libya called the photographs fabrications.
   U.S. officials said the two photographs showed one of the two
Libyan aircraft. Blurred spots were under the wings and on the
fuselage, and the United States said the spots indicate missiles.
   The Soviet Union and other nations said the photographs were too
blurred to prove the planes were armed.
   Last week, 17 speakers, mostly Arab and developing nations,
condemned the U.S. action as premeditated aggression.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, speaking to
reporters today in Paris, said he told Secretary of State George
Shultz that ``the most important thing is to stabilize the situation
after the air incident.''
   Shevardnadze and Shultz have been in Paris for an international
conference on chemical weapons.
   Earlier, Soviet Ambassador Alexander M. Belonogov, the permanent
U.N. representative, deplored the U.S. action in the Mediterranean
and said it hurt possibilities for Middle East peace.
   The United States and Britain are expected to veto any resolution
criticizing the U.S. action. The five permanent members with veto
power can kill any resolution on the 15-member council.
   The other permanent members are China, France and the Soviet
Union.

<HEAD>Four Convicted in Nazi Documents Theft From U.S.-run Center</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A court on Monday convicted a former employee of a
U.S.-run Nazi document center for his role in the theft of thousands
of files from the facility.
   The court sentenced Alfred Darko, former head of the center's
photographic department, to two years and four months in prison.
Three other defendants _ all Germans _ also were convicted and given
suspended sentences.
   Darko, a native of the Ivory Coast, was found guilty of stealing
4,000 Nazi files and selling them to dealers for up to $22,000.
   Chief judge Clemens Basdorf did not order Darko to prison
immediately. Darko, who has spent nine months in investigative
custody and who is reported to be in ill health, was ordered not to
leave West Berlin and to report to police once a week.
   Basdorf said Darko was not the only employee suspected in the
thefts, but he added that Darko had refused to identify individuals
he said stole the documents.
   ``Darko knows the truth, but we don't know why he will not name
the accomplices,'' Basdorf said.
   More than 10,000 documents are believed to be missing from the
center.
   The Berlin Document Center contains 30 million Nazi files seized
by the Allies after World War II. Among the documents are personnel
files of prominent Nazis and an almost complete list of Nazi Party
members.
   The thefts were discovered last year.
   Among the documents stolen was the personnel file of former
Gestapo officer Klaus Barbie, known as the Butcher of Lyon, who is
serving a life sentence in France for war crimes.
   A marriage request by SS officer Adolf Eichmann was also among
the documents stolen. Eichmann was executed in Israel after being
convicted of playing a major role in the Nazi deportation and murder
of millions of Jews.
   The court on Monday also found three other men guilty.
   A Hamburg military documents dealer, Andre Huesken, was sentenced
to two years' probation and fined $27,000 for selling many of the
documents to clients around the world.
   Two West Berlin antique dealers, Alfred Borrmann and Henry
Berger, also were given suspended sentences and fined for their
roles in delivering and selling the documents to dealers and
collectors.

   The U.N. organization said it spent $136 million for almost
550,000 tons of food in 1988, a 42 percent spending increase over
1987.
   The bigger expenditure reflects higher prices due to unfavorable

<TEXT>
   A group of black Americans vowed Monday to
revitalize efforts to promote closer ties between the administration
of President-elect George Bush and African nations.
   The African American Institute, meeting in Lusaka, sought a
greater understanding of African problems in the United States,
according to Randolph Nugent, the chairman of the institute's board
of trustees.
   Nugent told about 175 conferees in a welcoming address that the
institute believed U.S. administrations viewed Africa from a
short-term perspective.
   ``Our aim is to help bring Americans and Africans together to
help America take a long-term view of African problems,'' he said.
   Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda opened the four-day gathering by
urging world nations to focus more attention on the African debt
crisis.
   He cited burgeoning debt and South Afrca's policy of apartheid as
the ``root cause'' of conflict and suffering on the continent of 550
million people.
   Kaunda said many of the world's most heavily indebted nations
were in Africa but little was done by developed countries to offest
their loan burden.
   Between 1985 and 1987, African nations relying on exports of raw
materials for hard currency income lost an estimated $50 billion
through depressed commodity prices on world markets, he said.
   He chided unspecified Western nations for failing to impose
tougher trade sanctions against South Africa to end apartheid. Some
Western leaders argue that sanctions would harden white South
African resistance to change and hurt blacks the most.
   Among conferees from the United States and 17 African nations was
the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., chairman of the African Affairs
subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is expected
in Lusaka on Tuesday.
   The New York-based African American Institute holds a convention
in Africa every two years.

   The 1989 Wolf Foundation Prize in mathematics
was awarded to two Americans for their work in theoretical
mathematics and geometry, the foundation announced Monday.
   The $100,000 prize is to be shared by Alberto P. Calderon of the
University of Chicago and John W. Milnor of Princeton University.
   Calderon, born in Mendoza, Argentina, was cited for his
``groundbreaking work'' on differential equations, the foundation
said.
   Milnor, of Orange, N.J., was selected for his ``highly original
discoveries in geometry which have opened important new vistas,'' it
said.
   The prizes will be presented to Calderon and Milnor in May by
President Chaim Herzog.
   The privately run Wolf Foundation grants six annual awards of
$100,000 each in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine,
agriculture, mathematics and the arts. The other prizes are to be
announced later.
   The $12 million foundation was established in 1975 by Dr. Ricardo
Wolf, a German-born chemist and diplomat who emigrated to Cuba and
in 1961 became Cuba's ambassador to Israel. He lived in Israel until
his death in 1981.

   Aeron Clement, who wrote a successful book about
badgers titled ``The Cold Moons,'' has died at the age of 53.
   Clement died Sunday of complications from a heart bypass
operation six weeks earlier, said Bernard Kindred, a friend.
   ``The Cold Moons,'' which concentrates on one badger family, was
a success in paperback last year after major publishers had rejected
it.
   Penguin Books bought the publishing rights for $248,000 after
Clement and Kindred formed a company to publish the book and a first
print run of 5,000 quickly sold out.
   Clement had been working on a sequel about the threat to badgers'
survival when he died.
   He was born in Swansea, Wales, trained as an accountant, and
began writing after heart attacks forced him into early retirement.
He took up watching wildlife, especially badgers, around his home in
Llandeilo.
   Clement will be buried Thursday in Llandeilo. He is survived by
his wife and two daughters.

   Polish tourists sold $1 million in
vodka, Russian champagne and caviar on the black market in Sweden
last year, a newspaper reported Monday.
   The smuggled goods sold in the southern port city of Malmo last
year averaged up to $200 for each of the 50,000 Polish tourists who
visited the city, according to the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. The
goods also included crab, ham, clothes, crystal and amber worth $170
to $200.
   Police inspector Jonte Sterup was quoted as saying the Poles used
most of the money to buy U.S. dollars before they return home.

   Six in 10 Americans say homelessness afflicts
their own communities, and a majority would pay higher federal taxes
to help ease the problem, a Media General-Associated Press poll has
found.
   The national survey found wide agreement that homelessness is a
serious and worsening problem and general dissatisfaction with the
level of the federal government's response.
   Sixty percent of the respondents favored more federal spending
for the homeless, with nearly all in that group saying they would
pay higher taxes for that purpose.
   Accordingly, respondents rated the problem as extraordinarily
severe. Sixty-eight percent called it ``very serious'' and 24
percent said ``fairly serious.''
   The poll also exhibited the broad reach of homelessness:
Three-quarters said the problem plagues communities of all sizes,
not just big cities, and 59 percent said there were homeless people
in their own communities.
   The telephone survey, conducted among 1,084 randomly selected
adults Nov. 10-20, had a margin of error of plus or minus three
percentage points.
   The poll was completed before the holiday season and winter cold
refocused attention on the homeless. Still, 68 percent said
homelessness was worsening, just a quarter said it was unchanged and
a scant 3 percent saw improvement.
   A plurality said homelessness is primarily society's fault,
rather than the fault of the homeless themselves. Approaches such as
more housing for the homeless and subsidized apartments for the poor
won strong support.
   Views were divided on who is responsible for solutions. A 32
percent plurality said the federal government was chiefly
responsible for helping homeless people; 24 percent said state
governments; 18 percent said local governments; and 9 percent said
private charities. The rest had no opinion.
   Wherever prime responsibility lies, only 27 percent said the
federal government does enough to prevent people from becoming
homeless, and 58 percent said it does not. The remaining 15 percent
had no answer.
   Of the 60 percent who favored increasing federal spending on
programs for the homeless, 86 percent said they would be willing to
pay higher taxes for that purpose. Overall, 52 percent said they
would pay more to help the homeless.
   On specific programs, 62 percent said the federal government
should spend more on housing for the homeless, and 65 percent
favored the preventive measure of building more federally-subsidized
housing.
   Majorities of all groups favored subsidized housing, including
those least likely to support federal spending _ Republicans and
conservatives. In virtually all measures, however, homelessness was
seen as a problem by greater shares of women, Democrats, liberals,
minorities, lower-income respondents and younger people. They also
were more apt to blame society and to favor a broader federal
response.
   For example, 78 percent of women rated the problem as ``very
serious,'' compared with 56 percent of men. Eighty-three percent of
Democrats said it was getting worse, compared with 54 percent of
Republicans. And sixty-four percent of liberals said society was at
fault, compared with 37 percent of conservatives.
   Of those with family incomes under $25,000 a year, 73 percent
favored more subsidized housing for the poor; of those earning more
than $50,000, just 54 percent agreed.
   Respondents were divided on whether homeless people should be
allowed to live on the streets. Fifty-one percent said people should
not be allowed to live on the streets if they want to, but 45
percent said they should have that right.
   On the root cause of homelessness, 45 percent said society mainly
is at fault and 33 percent said the homeless themselves are chiefly
to blame. The rest, 22 percent, had no answer.

   The News Letter, the Belfast
daily that claims to be the world's oldest surviving
English-language newspaper, is to be sold, it was announced Monday.
   The Belfast Telegraph, a Belfast evening paper, said it would buy
the News Letter, its sister weekly the Sunday News, and two other
local free papers.
   The News Letter was founded in September 1737, although its
oldest surviving issue is from March 1738, and it prides itself on
being the first newspaper to report the American Declaration of
Independence on this side of the Atlantic.
   A morning daily since 1855, the paper has a circulation of 43,700
and is the voice of Northern Ireland Unionism _ the preservation of
the province's union with Britain and opposition to uniting the
island under rule from Dublin, capital of the Irish Republic.
   Capt. Bill Henderson, chairman of Century Newspapers, which owns
the News Letter, said the newspaper would remain ``the responsible
voice of Unionism in Ulster'' under the ownership of the
non-partisan Belfast Telegraph.
   Henderson said the company had needed massive capital investment,
new presses and computer systems, and the cost put the future of the
papers in doubt. He said he agreed to sell after the buyer
guaranteed to maintain the News Letter as a Unionist paper and to
invest in its future.
   The sale price was withheld pending government approval.

<TEXT>
   This Media General-Associated Press poll is based
on telephone interviews Nov. 10-20 with 1,084 adults in the
continental United States. The phone numbers were selected randomly
by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the
most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that if every
adult American were asked the same questions the results
theoretically would be within three points of the poll's results, 19
times out of 20. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ four
points for women, for example, and five for Democrats.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. In your opinion, how serious a problem is homelessness in the
United States? Is it very serious, fairly serious, not too serious,
or not serious at all? Very: 68 percent. Fairly: 24. Not too: 5. Not

   2. Do you think the problem of homelessness is getting worse,
improving, or staying about the same? Worse: 68. Improving: 3. Same:
24. DK-NA: 5.
   3. Who do you think should be primarily responsible for helping
homeless people _ the federal government, state government, local
government or private charities? Federal: 32. State: 24. Local: 18.
Charity: 9. DK-NA: 17.
   4. Do you think federal spending on helping the homeless should
be increased, decreased or remain the same? Increased: 60.
Decreased: 6. Same: 27. DK-NA: 7.
   a. (If increased) Would you be willing to pay more taxes for
that? Yes: 86. No: 11. DK-NA: 3.
   5. Thinking about why most people are homeless, would you say
society is mainly at fault, or the homeless personally are mainly at
fault? Society: 45. Homeless: 33. DK-NA: 22.
   6. Do you think homelessness is a problem only in big cities, or
in communities of all sizes? Cities: 24. All sizes: 74. DK-NA: 2.
   7. Does the federal government do enough to prevent people from
becoming homeless, or not? Yes: 27. No: 58. DK-NA: 15.
   8. Should the federal government build more subsidized housing
for poor people? Yes: 65. No: 27. DK-NA: 8.

   A trial of avowed revolutionaries that
has already cost the government millions of dollars moved toward
opening arguments almost a year after lawyers began selecting jurors.
   The three remaining defendants of eight who were captured in one
of the largest manhunts in U.S. history are accused of sedition, or
conspiring to topple the government by force, under a rarely invoked
law whose meaning has been the subject of much courtroom wrangling.
   ``It is a serious threat to fundamental liberties,'' said Peter
Avenia, one of six defense lawyers.
   Prosecutors contend, however, that the charge of sedition fits
the group they describe as a dangerous band of terrorists. A Boston
courthouse worker lost a leg and 21 other people were wounded in one
of the score of bombings the group allegedly plotted from 1976 to
1985.
   Jury selection began last March with a vast pool of jurors.
Selection of the final few jurors in the U.S. District Court trial
wound up this morning with the seating of 12 jurors and five
alternates. Opening arguments were slated to begin Tuesday.
   Up to 350 witnesses could be called. A closed-circuit camera has
been installed with monitors in another room in case defendants are
ejected for unruliness. Observers must pass through two metal
detectors to reach the courtroom, which an estimated 40 marshals
take turns guarding.
   The defendants each face up to 60 years in prison and $60,000 in
fines if convicted on the charges of seditious conspiracy,
racketeering conspiracy and racketeering enterprise.
   Their attorneys argue that the trial is a waste of money because
their clients already have been convicted on bombing and bank
robbery charges and all but one are serving prison sentences. The
cost so far is estimated at well over $3 million.
   The defense attorneys say the seditious conspiracy statute is so
broad that it could be used against protesters blocking streets.
   ``If people engage in political dissent and think this can't
happen to them, they should read the statute,'' said Avenia.
   The statute makes it a crime for ``two or more persons in any
state or territory to conspire to overthrow or put down or destroy
by force the government of the United States.''
   The government has used the statute only a few times since it was
first invoked to punish Confederates during the Civil War, said
Arthur D. Wolf, a professor at Western New England College in
Springfield.
   It was used to keep protesters from hindering the draft during
World War I and to prosecute Puerto Rican nationalists accused in an
assassination attempt against then-President Harry Truman. Last
April, nine white supremacists were acquitted of seditious
conspiracy charges in Arkansas.
   In the case going to trial here, an FBI hunt for the defendants
swept through hundreds of towns in Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
Vermont, Connecticut, New York and Ohio in 1983.
   Arrested in their Cleveland house on Nov. 4, 1984, were Jaan
Laaman, 40; his wife, Barbara J. Curzi-Laaman, 31; and Richard
Williams, 41. Agents in Deerfield, Ohio, arrested Raymond Luc
Levasseur, 42, and his wife, Patricia Gros Levasseur, 34, the same
day. Carol A. Manning, 33, and her husband, Thomas Manning, 42, were
apprehended six months later in Norfolk, Va. Christopher King, 38,
was arrested in North Attleboro in 1982.
   The federal trial was moved to Springfield in 1987 so that
defendants could be housed together at a jail in nearby Hartford,
Conn.
   The only defendants, however, are Williams and the Levasseurs.
The five others either have changed their pleas to guilty or been
dropped from the case. Mrs. Levasseur is out on bail, having
finished a five-year term for possessing false identification and
harboring her fugitive husband.
   King was tried separately in 1987. He pleaded guilty that
December to one count of seditious conspiracy and was sentenced to
seven years in prison.
   In August, the government dropped charges against Manning and
Laaman, saying Manning already was serving 53 years and Laaman, 45
years, for bombings. Manning also got a life sentence for the 1981
shooting death of a New Jersey state trooper.
   Mrs. Manning pleaded guilty two weeks ago to all three counts.
She was sentenced to five years, to be served concurrently with her
15-year term on bombing charges.
   On Friday, the First Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a decision
suppressing evidence against Mrs. Curzi-Laaman because it was seized
without a search warrant. The decision meant she would be tried
separately. She is serving a 15-year sentence.

   Police in the central Yugoslav
republic of Bosnia have discovered a cache of firearms and
ammunition ``used by terrorists,'' media reports said Monday.
   Authorities in Sarajevo, the republic's capital, said the find
included a U.S.-made automatic rifle, four pistols, eight revolvers
and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, reports said.
   The newspaper, Borba, quoted police as saying the weapons and
ammunition were of the kind ``most often used by terrorists.''
   To date, officials have refused to identify a man detained before
the New Year's holidays on allegations of trying to smuggle the
rifle and four pistols into the country.
   A subsequent search of his home yielded the remaining arms, Borba
reported.
   The police statement did not identify the terrorist group to
which the detained man is accused of belonging. However, leaflets
and publications of banned Croatian nationalist groups were shown
with the state TV report on the arms cache.
   Croatian extremists have been blamed for several bombings and
attacks in Yugoslavia in the past 20 years.

   Television portrayals of lawyers as
``aggressive, loud, obnoxious persons who insult judges'' is
ungentle- manly and -womanly, and the Kentucky Bar Association wants
to be sure life doesn't imitate TV.
   The association has decreed that Kentucky's lawyers should be
courteous in the courtroom and friendly with their colleagues and
that the lawyers should never intentionally mislead or deceive their
adversaries.
   The Code of Professional Courtesy, endorsed by the association's
governing board in September, carries no penalties.
   But George Long II, the association's president, said it will
remind lawyers to watch their Ps and Qs.
   Long acknowledged that the law inherently involves conflict. But
he said it should be practiced courteously.
   Richard Frymire, head of the association's Committee on Lawyer
Professionalism, which drafted the code, said it is designed to
counter television portrayals of lawyers as ``aggressive, loud,
obnoxious persons who insult judges'' _ and a growing sense that is
how real lawyers are supposed to behave.
   ``I think it's terrible that a profession like the law has to
have this type of code imposed,'' said Martin Johnstone, the chief
Jefferson Circuit Court judge. ``But from what I've seen over the
past few years, I think it's necessary.''
   Still, some practitioners say the code may clash with more
important ethical requirements, and describe it as vague and even
silly.
   ``Why do we have to be friendly?'' asked Louisville lawyer C.
Thomas Hectus. ``Am I supposed to inquire as to how are the wife and
kids?''
   Writing in the association's magazine, Bench &amp; Bar, U.S. District
Judge William Bertelsman said lawyers have become ``more aggressive
and harder to get along with.'' He said judges must devote
increasing time to refereeing abusive tactics that range from
``benign incivility to outright obstruction.''
   ``I absolutely believe a lawyer can zealously represent clients
and abide by all precepts'' of the code, said Frymire.

   Take his land. Please.
   Robert Luther has 1.2 acres of land, zoned for development, that
he can't sell or even give away. In the meantime, he has to keep
paying taxes that were $1,275 last year.
   The Smithfield resident inherited the parcel in 1985 from his
brother. It is zoned for industry in an area where there has been
considerable recent development. But 80 percent is swampland, and
any alteration for construction requires federal and state consent.
   ``I've had a couple of people look at it, but when they have had
engineers look at it they decided to forget it,'' he said. Two
engineering firms hired by Luther have said the land is unsuitable
for construction in its present state.
   Luther then tried to give it to Providence College, his alma
mater, but they weren't interested.
   So he tried to give it to the town, but the town council isn't
welcoming the offer with open arms either.
   ``You don't look a gift horse in the mouth,'' said Town Council
President Anthony B. Simeone. But the council wants to study the
matter.
   Luther said some have suggested he just stop paying taxes, in
which case the town would seize it and try to recoup the lost taxes
at a tax sale. Luther said he'll wait to hear from the town council
before deciding his next move.

   Tyrone Nelson thought he heard an explosion
Monday morning and jumped from beneath the covers only to find a car
hanging over his bed.
   His wife, Darlene, 36, sustained leg injuries when she was hit by
the front end of the car that crashed into their first-floor bedroom
and by debris that filled the room. She was treated at the Greater
Baltimore Medical Center and released, police said. Nelson was
unhurt.
   Officer Greg Taylor said a Baltimore County Police officer was
following a suspected stolen car when the car went out of control,
moved along a 100-foot grass strip and then crashed into the
apartment.
   Just before the crash, Officer Richard Theis lost control of his
car as well and hit a fence, but was uninjured.
   In the confusion, the driver of the car that hit the apartment
escaped, although the transmission of the car landed in the Nelsons'
bathroom and the force of the impact left a gaping hole in a bedroom
wall, shattered windows and mirrors and disrupted electrical power.
   Police said the intruding car had been registered to a dealership.

   Hearing screams, Kawaguchi's son rushed from a second-floor

   The official said police arrested two of the men on the street

   The Legislature doesn't convene until later
this month, but members have already begun tackling one of the
toughest issues _ office space.
   It's a cutthroat political game, played like this: Legislative
leaders get the best offices, veteran legislators fight over the
leaders' old offices and new members scramble for whatever's left.
   Rep. Marlin Schneider of Wisconsin Rapids, who's in charge of
office assignments, humorously threatened to call in an air strike
by the Wisconsin National Guard unless warring factions in the
Capitol's north wing resolved their own territorial dispute.
   In the same spirit, he proposed capital punishment _ and
something worse than that _ for legislators who try to make off with
their old office furniture.
   ``Failure to cooperate may result in death by firing squad, or no
pork for you in the budget,'' he warned colleagues in a memorandum
on unauthorized furniture moving.
   But even that dire threat didn't keep Rep. Joseph Wineke of
Verona from moving his desk chair from his old office to his new one.
   ``I stole that chair personally years ago, and I'm keeping it,''
Wineke said.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said Monday he will
seek passage of legislation to deny foreign chemical companies
access to U.S. markets if they are found to have assisted in the
proliferation of chemical weapons.
   Nickles said the bill will be an effort ``to put some teeth'' in
a proposed international agreement banning the use, storage and
production of chemical weapons worldwide.
   ``This is an effort to make sure that if we do catch them we
would do something about it,'' said Nickles, noting that certain
West German chemical companies are alleged to have helped Iraq and
Libya attain chemical warfare capability.
   Nickles, who attended the ongoing conference on chemical weapons
in Paris, told a news conference that while he found the meeting
helpful, he continues to believe that ``the utopian goal of banning
nuclear weapons will be close to impossible.''
   He said that events like the use of poison gas in the Iran-Iraq
war show that even some signers of the 1925 international agreement
banning the use of chemical weapons have clearly violated it.
   ``Measures are lacking that would impose some penalties if
countries don't comply,'' he said. ``We have to have some teeth
behind these treaties.''
   He said he will seek passage, in partnership with Senate
Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, of legislation imposing
sanctions on individual companies involved in chemical weapons
proliferation.

   ``This is a major case and at least 50 detectives are assigned to
it,'' Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said after the body of Dr.
Kathryn Hinnant was found in a laboratory office Sunday morning by
her husband.
   Authorities today said that Ms. Hinnant had been raped and robbed
of $75 and a mink coat.
   ``It was a particularly brutal, outrageous murder,'' said Mayor
Edward I. Koch, who termed it a ``No. 1 case to be solved.''
   The city offered a $30,000 reward for information.
   Officials said security at the 1,200-bed municipal hospital would
be reviewed, but an initial check found nothing out of the ordinary
at the time of the murder.
   Her husband, Eric Johnson, 33, a piano salesman, said she was
five months pregnant. Police have said he is not a suspect.
   Officials said he was not unduly worried at first when his wife
didn't return from work Saturday evening. But when she did not call
or come home overnight, Johnson went to the hospital Sunday morning.
He and a hospital administrator found Ms. Hinnant's body in a small,
fourth-floor office.
   Hinnant, a native of Columbia, S.C., was a 1982 graduate of the
Medical University of South Carolina and had worked in Washington
before coming to Bellevue in 1987, police said.

   Here are excerpts from the text of the budget
message which President Reagan sent to Congress on Monday.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Eight years ago many in this country were concerned about the
future of our economy, our government and, indeed, the nation
itself. ...
   To resolve the economic problems then facing us, our
administration proposed a recovery program centering on four
fundamental principles:
   _Reduce personal and business tax rates.
   _Reduce the rate of growth of federal spending.
   _Reduce the federal regulatory burden by eliminating unnecessary
restrictions while protecting the public's interest and safety.
   _Support a moderate and steady monetary policy to bring inflation
under control.
   To rebuild our defense capabilities and restore America's
standing in the world we proposed expanded national security and
international programs. ...
   Today, the American people can be proud of the progress that has
been made on each of these fronts. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The one area in which I have been persistently disappointed
throughout my term of office has been in the efforts to bring the
budget under control.
   Time and again I have proposed measures to help curb federal
domestic program spending. Time and again these proposals have been
rejected by Congress. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The fiscal year 1990 budget, my last, represents a continuation
of my efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit through restraint
in domestic spending.
   The budget I am submitting today complies with the deficit
targets set in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings (G-R-H) Act, by proposing
measures that meet the 1990 deficit target of $100 billion and
assure a steady reduction in the deficit leading to a balanced
budget in 1993. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   This budget shows that a gradual elimination of the deficit is
possible without raising taxes, without cutting into essential
social programs, without devastating defense, and without neglecting
other national priorities.
   It can be done in a reasonable, responsible way _ with discipline
and fairness.
   New taxes are not required. ...
   We have an opportunity this year to put the worst of the deficit
problem behind us and enable the next administration to begin its
term of office with a clean slate and with the promise of continuing
prosperity. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   To address urgent national priorities within the deficit limit
set by the G-R-H Act, my budget proposes that some programs _ such
as those for AIDS research and prevention, drug enforcement, and
technology development _ receive significant funding increases,
while others are reduced, reformed, or, in some cases, terminated.
...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Maintaining peace and protecting our country are the foremost
responsibilities of the federal government.
   Defense budget authority declined in real (inflation-adjusted)
terms for the fourth straight year with funding of $299 billion for
1989.
   This trend cannot continue without severe impact on combat
readiness.
   Therefore, my budget requests defense funding of $315 billion in
budget authority and $303 billion in outlays for 1990, and $331
billion in budget authority and $314 billion in outlays in 1991. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   This budget reflects my belief that addressing the problem of
AIDS must remain a top priority:
   _Preventing and alleviating suffering from the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, is our highest
public health priority. Federal support for research, prevention,
and treatment exceeds $2.1 billion in 1989, and will approach $2.8
billion in 1990. This budget asks for $1.6 billion, or 24 percent
over 1989, for Public Health Service HIV funding. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The program structure and incentives underlying many domestic
federal programs need to be altered to promote greater efficiency
and cost-effectiveness.
   _Current farm price support programs are far too costly.
   For the period 1986-89 an estimated $130 billion in federal
spending for farm-related assistance programs provided an average of
nearly $600,000 per farmer.
   Much of this assistance goes to farmers with high incomes _ more
than twice the U.S. family average.
   I therefore propose outlay reductions for the price and income
support programs of $2 billion in 1990 and additional annual
reductions of between $2 and $2.5 billion in each year from 1991
through 1994. ...
   _The rapidly rising costs of the Medicare program need to be
moderated.
   I propose a reasonable increase in the Medicare prospective
payment system rate and reductions in hospital capital payments and
special graduate medical education payments.
   Also, in an effort to restrain excessive growth in supplementary
medical insurance (SMI) costs, I propose extension of the current
law SMI premiums, limitations on physican payments, reductions in
payments for certain overpriced procedures, and reforms in the
durable medical equipment payment system.
   Medicare spending would still grow by 9 percent between 1989 and
1990 under these proposals _ but not by the 13 percent that would
occur under current law. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   As the federal government grew, it took on improper
responsibilities, and managed its programs inefficiently.
   We undertook to return the federal government to its proper role.
   We also initiated a major program to improve the management of
the remaining programs.
   These priorities are continued and expanded in this budget. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The persistence of the budget deficit is overwhelming evidence
that the federal budget process is fundamentally flawed.
   Past efforts at ``reform'' have been directed largely toward
protecting a large portion of domestic spending from real fiscal
discipline. ...
   Except for last year's on-time performance, Congress'
self-imposed budget deadlines have usually been missed, and massive
continuing resolutions and reconciliation bills have been the rule
rather than the exception.
   These large, cumbersome bills provide cozy hiding places for
hundreds of special interest add-ons, which line-item veto authority
would permit the president to challenge. ...
   _I remain committed to and urge approval of a constitutional
amendment requiring a balanced budget.
   The amendment should require a supermajority vote (at least 60
percent) in the Congress to increase taxes. ...
   _My successors should be given the authority, subject to
congressional override, to veto line-items in annual appropriations
bills, in authorizing legislation that provides or mandates funding
for programs, and in revenue bills.
   Such authority would permit the elimination of substantial waste
and would be an effective instrument for enforcing budget
discipline. ...
   _The annual budget process consumes too much time and energy.
   A biennial budget would reduce the repetitive budget tasks, allow
more time for considering key spending and revenue decisions,
provide less scope for gimmicks that give the illusion of
``savings,'' such as shifting spending from one year to another
without affecting the underlying programs, and permit the
realization of real savings that would be possible with a more
assured availability of funds. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The accomplishments of the American people in the past eight
years will always be for me a source of pride.
   However, we must continue our recent progress in reducing the
federal deficit.
   Deficit reduction is a key national priority, written into law by
the G-R-H Act, which, despite its defects, legislated a process to
achieve a balanced budget.
   This budget achieves the 1990 target of the amended act, and
projects a budget balance in 1993.
   It preserves legitimate programs for the aged and needy, provides
for adequate national security, devotes more resources to other
high-priority activities, and accomplishes all this without raising
taxes.
   Tax increases are not needed.
   History shows that they would simply be used by the Congress to
increase spending.
   Tax increases have been overwhelmingly voted down in the last
three presidential elections.
   I call upon the Congress to enact this budget.
   Higher taxes are not needed _ as this budget demonstrates _ but
genuine deficit reduction through moderating the growth in spending
is essential to enable the next administration and Congress to
address the nation's agenda for the future.

<HEAD>Reagan Would Block Tax Cut for Fliers, Make State Workers Pay for
Medicare</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   True to his word, President Reagan's final
budget calls for no general tax increase, although it would halt a
scheduled cut in aviation taxes and require all state and local
government workers to pay for Medicare.
   The budget that Reagan submitted to Congress on Monday includes a
$2.1 billion tax cut for corporations and $39 million of tax relief
for the oil and gas industries.
   Overall, revenues would drop by $1 billion, compared with current
law, under the budget for fiscal 1990, the 12 months that begin next
Oct. 1.
   Most of the revenue changes had been proposed a year ago; in
fact, the president has submitted some of them for several years
running, only to have them ignored or rejected by Congress.
   Reagan's written message cited his final budget as evidence
``that a gradual elimination of the deficit is possible without
raising taxes....''
   ``Tax increases are not needed,'' the president continued. ``Tax
increases have been overwhelmingly voted down in the last three
presidential elections.''
   However, among the hundreds of tables in the budget documents is
one showing that during Reagan's eight years in office, Congress
passed and he signed 13 separate tax increases that will cost
taxpayers $150 billion during the next budget year. Reagan-era tax
reductions will save taxpayers $377 billion next year.
   In addition to the tax changes he proposed for 1990, Reagan
recommended $1 billion of fees on those who use selected government
services. The largest single provision in this package, $394
million, would raise the 1 percent fee for VA loan guarantees to 3.8
percent and make it permanent.
   Another recommendation would require middle- and upper-income
veterans to pay a portion of the cost of government medical care for
non-service-connected problems.
   Commercial and recreational boaters would have to pay a $25
annual charge for using Coast Guard-patrolled waterways; entrance
fees would be imposed for Corps of Engineer recreational facilities;
charges at Forest Service facilities would be broadened, and the fee
on Commodity Credit Corp. loan guarantees would double, to 1.2
percent.
   Among the tax proposals:
   _Repeal a law requiring that taxes on airplane tickets (8
percent), air shippers (5 percent) and plane fuel be cut in half
next Jan. 1 unless federal spending for airports and airways reaches
a certain level. That level is not expected to be reached, but
Reagan called for keeping those taxes at current rates, which would
cost shippers and travelers $1.2 billion.
   _Require all state and local government workers to pay the tax
that funds Medicare; those hired before April 1, 1986, are not
paying, even though most are eligible for Medicare because of
earlier, non-government employment or through their spouses. This
would raise $2 billion.
   _Permit corporations that operate abroad to allocate at least
two-thirds of their total research costs to domestic income, saving
them $1.7 billion.
   _Make permanent a 20 percent tax credit for increased spending
for research, saving those businesses $400 milllion.
   _Liberalize deductions permitted oil and gas producers for
depletion, at a cost to the treasury of $39 million.
   _Increase Internal Revenue Service enforcement activities,
producing a $300 million boost in tax collections.
   Reagan again proposed to sell U.S. oilfields at Teapot Dome,
Wyo., and Elk Hills, Calif., for $1 billion, and all or parts of
several power-marketing administrations, including those in Alaska
and the Southeast, which would bring in $1.3 billion in 1990.
   The budget also proposes to raise money by selling or allowing
prepayment of $6.9 billion of government loans for $5.8 billion,
including those for college housing, and Small Business
Administration loans for business and disaster relief.

   China's most prominent dissident on Monday called
for the release of the nation's most famous political prisoner. In
Shanghai, meanwhile, a pro-democracy activist was let out of jail.
   Fang Lizhi, an internationally respected astrophysicist, said
freeing all political prisoners, especially Wei Jingsheng, ``would
be a humanitarian gesture and would have a beneficial effect on our
social morale.''
   Fang made his call in a letter to Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping
that was obtained Monday.
   Wei, an electrician by profession, wrote a series of articles on
the need for democracy in 1978 during the ``Beijing Spring,'' a
period of relative political liberalization shortly after the end of
the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution. He was arrested on March 29,
1979, and sentenced to 15 years in prison for
``counterrevolutionary'' crimes.
   Amnesty Internatiomal, a London-based human rights group, has
adopted Wei as a prisoner of conscience. Human rights groups have
variously reported that Wei has died or is suffering from severe
schizophrenia in custody.
   Amnesty International estimates thousands of Chinese are in
prison for crimes of conscience.
   Fang was expelled from the Communist Party and fired from his
post as vice chairman of the Chinese Science and Technology
University in Hefei in 1987 for allegedly fomenting pro-democracy
unrest among the nation's students.
   He later was given a position as a high-level researcher at the
Chinese Academy of Sciences and allowed to travel abroad. China has
denied Fang's most recent request to go to the United States.
   In winter 1986-87, hundreds of thousands of students marched in
cities and called for democracy in China.
   Yang Wei, a former student at the University of Arizona, was one
of the demonstrators.
   On Monday, Yang was released from the Ti Lan Qiao Prison in
Shanghai after serving one year of a two-year sentence for
``counterrevolutionary'' activities.
   The Shanghai Foreign Affairs office said Yang was released Monday
because he had already spent about a year in custody before being
sentenced.
   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, Yang said his
first concern was the health of his father, who has cancer.
   ``I'm going to see him today,'' said Yang. ``He is in the
hospital and he is in serious condition.''
   Yang said he did not regret marching for democracy and writing
for ``China Spring,'' the banned periodical of the Chinese Alliance
for Democracy, a U.S.-based dissident group. But he said he was
unclear whether he would continue working for political change in
China.
   Yang described his treatment in prison as ``pretty good.''
   ``It seemed that I was given special treatment,'' he said.
   Yang, 33, who received a masters degree in molecular biology from
Arizona, said he would like to return to the United States to
continue his studies.
   Sources close to the family said Yang's release was delayed by
several hours because three members of the Chinese Alliance for
Democracy were apprehended in Shanghai over the weekend with copies
of ``China Spring'' and a letter for Ywng.
   The alliance was set up in 1983 by a former Chinese citizen in
order to promote democracy in China. Chinese officials have declared
it an illegal organization.
   The men _ a Chinese-American, a Chinese-Canadian and a Chinese
citizen _ were put on flights out of China after they admitted
breaking the law, official reports said.
   It was not clear why the Chinese citizen, who is a student at
Utah State University, was allowed to leave.
   Yang was sentenced in December 1987. He had been held without
charges since January 1987 in the student protests.
   Prosecutors accused Yang of stirring up anti-government protests
in Shanghai. The court said he put up ``reactionary slogans'' at
Shanghai's Fudan University on Dec. 22, 1986, during student
demonstrations.
   On Dec. 3, 1987, the U.S. Congress called for Yang's release,
saying he had broken no Chinese or U.S. laws.
   China labeled the move ``an undisguised interference in China's
internal affairs.''
   Yang's wife, Che Shaoli, a medical student in the United States,
said she was thrilled at his release. ``But I am sad, too,'' she
said in a telephone interview from New York. ``I don't know when I
will see him.''

   The State Department said Monday a top Mexican
official newly appointed by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is
under indictment for alleged involvement in a car theft ring in
southern California.
   ``We believe that persons under indictment should face their
charges in court,'' department spokesman Charles Redman said.
   Redman did not name the official but published reports over the
weekend identified him as Miguel Nazar Haro, the chief of a newly
created intelligence unit in the Mexico City police department.
   The car theft ring was smashed in 1981 by the FBI and California
police.
   The Washington Post said in its Saturday editions that several
top antinarcotics and law enforcement officials appointed to
Salinas' six-week old government are suspected of having links to
major Mexican drug traffickers. The Post cited Mexican and foreign
sources.
   In response, Redman said, ``I would note ... that the Mexican
government does conduct a substantial anti-narcotics effort and
President Salinas has announced plans for new programs which, in his
words, are `to make life miserable,' as he has said, for the
traffickers.''

   About 1,500 workers at a coal mine near
Jastrzebie in southern Poland staged a successful two-hour work
stoppage Monday seeking improved working conditions, the banned
Solidarity trade union said.
   Miners at the Morcinek mine wanted a six-hour limit to the amount
of time miners can be forced to work in high temperatures, said
Wojciech Maziarski, a spokesman for the Solidarity Information
Service in Warsaw.
   They also asked for bonus pay for working under such conditions,
he said.
   Maziarski said management agreed to the demands after the
``warning strike,'' which lasted from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m., and several
hours of talks with workers' representatives from a Solidarity
committee at the mine and the official OPZZ trade union.
   There was no immediate information about the stoppage in the
official media, and a dispatcher at the mine refused comment when
reached by telephone.

<HEAD>New Law to Give Tax Breaks for Inventions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is trying to foster a
technological spurt with a proposal to offer tax breaks for
state-run enterprises that put new inventions to use, an official
said Monday.
   I.S. Nayashkov, chairman of the State Committee on Inventions and
Discoveries, told a news conference that a draft law on inventions
proposes giving a three-year income tax exemption to state-run
businesses that put inovations to use.
   Officials hope such a move will ``increase the interest of
enterprises in inventive work or in research and development,'' he
said. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev says more modern technology is
a key to modernizing Soviet industry and providing a higher standard
of living.
   The draft law was published in the official press Dec. 27, and
must be approved by the Supreme Soviet, or parliament, at one of its
sessions in 1989. It is unclear yet when it will go into effect.
   The law also would allow the establishment of venture banks to
encourage investors and set aside ``patent funds'' to help inventors
without the means to support their work, Nayashkov said.
   He said there has been ``little movement and weak dynamics'' in
recent years, with the number of applications for patents and the
number actually registered remaining virtually without change.
   Since 1983-84, Soviets have applied for between 170,000 and
190,000 patents annually and 70,000-80,000 have been granted, he
said. The remainder were judged not to offer anything substantially
new or valuable.
   Nayashkov said the law also seeks to better protect foreigners by
bringing Soviet patent law closer to a convention signed in
Washington in 1970, and gives Soviets the right to register their
inventions in foreign countries instead of the Soviet Union as long
as their inventions don't concern defense matters or state secrets.

<HEAD>Soviet Union to Conduct Census Beginning Jan. 12</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet officials will conduct a census beginning
Thursday that they say will give them a much broader understanding
of the population and citizens' living conditions.
   More than a million students, teachers and white-collar workers
will fan out across the vast country from Jan. 12-19 with a
questionnaire that for the first time will ask a series of questions
about housing conditions.
   But Mikhail S. Korolev, chairman of the State Statistics
Committee, said no questions will be asked about religion, or about
salaries.
   Previous surveys have determined that the population does not
give reliable answers about their income, he said. ``Some people
hide their income. Some people increase it before other members of
the family. Some people fantasize,'' he said.
   Korolev pledged that all responses will be confidential, sealed
by census workers after the information is fed into computer. He
said the results will be made public, but not as early as officials
originally thought.
   ``There will be no disclosure of personal data to anyone,''
Korolev told a news conference.
   The census has been extended until Feb. 11 in Armenia because of
the Dec. 7 earthquake, and that means initial figures won't be
available in April as scientists originally thought, Korolev said.
   Some Soviet publications contend that dictator Josef Stalin
falsified census data in the 1930s and destroyed a 1937 census to
hide massive deaths caused by his collectivization of agriculture
and purges.
   Korolev said he knew of no cases of falsifying census data, but
that the results from the 1937 census were missing.
   In 1934, Stalin announced a population figure of 168 million,
even though the official figure was 165.7 million and one scientist
put the actual figure as low as 158 million.
   Soviet reference books put the population at the time of the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution at 163 million, and Korolev said experts
estimate the population now is about 287 million.
   The head of the statistics committee said questions about housing
that will appear for the first time include the age of housing in
which respondents live, what the buildings are made of, whether the
housing is state-owned or cooperative, the number of rooms and the
floor area.
   That list of questions, developed along United Nations
guidelines, will give officials an idea of what kinds of housing are
most durable as well as firm data about what kinds of housing
Soviets are living in, he said.
   Housing is one of the sore spots in efforts to improve living
conditions, and about one in five still lives in communal housing.
Much of the housing, such as that which collapsed in the Armenian
earthquake, is of poor construction.
   The last full census 10 years ago showed a population of 262
million. A pilot census was taken five years ago.

<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libya's official news agency on Monday
criticized foreign journalists who reported there were weapons
around the desert factory the United States alleges is a chemical
weapons plant.
   About 100 journalists were expelled from Libya on Sunday, and
about 30 others were told late Sunday that they had to depart Monday.
   They arrived last week after U.S. fighter jets shot down two
Libyan warplanes over the Mediterranean.
   The expulsion orders came a few hours after the journalists were
taken Saturday evening to the plant at Rabta, 60 miles southwest of
Tripoli.
   Libya insists the plant is designed for producing medicine.
   Journalists were not allowed inside the plant, and because it was
nightfall when they arrived by bus, they could see very little from
the outside.
   Clearly visible, however, was a ring of surface-to-air missiles
around the plant, as well as a concrete-based radar station a few
miles away. Libyan officials said the defenses were put into place
after President Reagan last month said he could not rule out a
military strike against the plant.
   Libya's official news agency, JANA, on Monday said the
journalists were invited to see the plant ``as an expression of good
will and out of its concern to enable them to acquaint themselves
with the reality of a small country upon which aggression and
confrontation are imosed by a superpower, namely America.
   ``Statements in some news reports that the mere fact of the
journalists seeing the buildings did not help determine the nature
of these buildings and that there are weapons, guns and buildings
are inaccurate and lack objectivity,'' JANA said. ``The journalists,
unless they are are specially qualified, are not experts in
determining the nature of the factory and its installations.
   ``Adopting the argument of the existence of guns and weapons in
the area surrounding the factory to give it another character falls
in line with the desires of some and the reply to it is: in the face
of the threats of America to deal a blow to the area, are the masses
who are staging a sit-in there not entitled to make available the
means to defend the area and to protect themselves?'' the dispatch
said.
   Libya, it said, ``in so far as it is concerned with enabling
journalists to carry out their professional duties, requires the
necessary commitment to the rules of neutrality, objectivity and
impartiality'' from journalists.
   Libya's foreign minister, in Paris for a conference on chemical
weapons, said Sunday his country had no plans to manufacture
chemical weapons. When asked if Libya planned to make such arms, he
replied: ``You will never know.''

<HEAD>Vanna-Less Pat Sajak Latest to Take on Carson's Hold as Late Night
King</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pat Sajak, the ex-local weatherman who rode to
national stardom on ``Wheel of Fortune,'' spins his personal wheel
of fortune tonight as the latest personality to challenge Johnny
Carson as late-night TV king.
   A full-page advertisement in today's Daily Variety industry
newspaper urges TV viewers to tune in ``The Pat Sajak Show,''
imploring: ``Don't go to bed until you turn him on.''
   Sajak, who is staying on with his evening ``Wheel of Fortune''
duties but quitting the daytime version, debuts his 90-minute CBS
talk show with Chevy Chase, Joan Van Ark and Michael Gross slated as
guests.
   Sajak, 42, said he has realistic expectations, adding the network
hasn't given him a ratings goal.
   ``I do know they don't think someone's going to go in there and
knock somebody else off,'' Sajak said. The show goes up against
Carson and the first half of ``Late Night With David Letterman'' on
NBC, and ABC's ``Nightline.''
   ``I would not be surprised if in some back office in this
building someone has said, `Hey look, it may be one year, it may be
two years, it may be five years, but eventually Johnny's going to
leave. And we'll have our little niche. We'll be in good shape,'''
Sajak said.
   Past challengers to NBC's venerable ``The Tonight Show With
Johnny Carson'' have faired poorly. The airwaves have been littered
with victims trying to unseat Carson, including Joan Rivers, Alan
Thicke, Joey Bishop and Dick Cavett.

<HEAD>Slight Increase Asked For Veterans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Monday asked Congress for a
small increase in funding for veterans' medical care and pensions as
he proposed outlays of $29.9 billion for the new Department of
Veterans Affairs.
   Outlays for the Veterans Administration, which provided benefits
and services to veterans for 58 years, are estimated to be $29.2
billion in fiscal 1989. The budget for the new department, which
assumes Cabinet status in March, calls for a $700 million increase.
   Among the budget proposals are a slight increase in outlays for
medical care, including the treatment provided to veterans at
hospitals, nursing homes and on an outpatient basis. In fiscal 1989,
outlays totaled $11.4 billion. The 1990 budget calls for $11.5
billion.
   Outlays for construction of state extended care facilities
increased from $37 million in 1989 to $44 million in 1990 while
outlays for major project construction was cut from $527 million to
$514 million.
   The budget proposes using construction funds for two large
hospital projects in Palm Beach, Fla., and Newington, Conn.
   Proposed outlays for total pensions are $4 billion, a $94 million
increase over the estimated total for fiscal 1989. Veterans age 65
or older with low incomes and wartime-service are entitled to the
pensions. The wartime-service does not differentiate between combat
or non-combat duty.
   The pension payments also included a 4 percent cost-of-living
increase effective this month.
   Total outlays for income security for disabled, aged or deceased
veterans in the 1990 budget are $16.4 billion, up from $15.6 billin
in 1989.
   The Reagan administration, in the budget, also recommends linking
future veterans compensation cost-of-living adjustments to annual
changes in the Consumer Price Index.
   The administration also proposes changes in the veterans housing
program, including orgination fees for participating in federal
credit programs. The budget plan did not specify the cost of the
fees.
   Two other recommendations affecting housing for veterans propose
legislation to increase the expiring fee charged on guaranteed
housing loans and vendee loans and to allow negotiated interest
rates on guaranteed mortgages.
   The expiring fee charge would increase from 1 percent to 3.8
percent of the mortgage amount and the borrower could add the fee to
the mortgage. A vendee loan is a direct loan made to veterans and
non-veterans who purchase property that the Veterans Administration
acquired through defaults.
   The administration also is seeking budget authority of $1.5
million for the court of Veterans Appeals, which would allow
veterans to appeal some benefit decisions of the department's Board
of Veterans' Appeals.
   Facing a major cut are grants for the construction of state
veterans cemeteries, which would be reduced from $5 million in 1989
to $1.9 million in 1990.
   The funding would be used to expand national cemeteries at Fort
Snelling, Minn., and Jefferson Barracks, Mo.

   Authorities arrested 61 people who rioted
over confusion surrounding a new food subsidy program, officials
said Monday.
   Rioting broke out in the central Zambian town of Luanshya on
Sunday and paramilitary police were dispatched to restore order,
said provincial political secretary Boniface Mapani.
   No further details of the police action were given. Local media
reports said the rioting followed the introduction of a coupon
system to buy corn meal, Zambia's staple food.
   Coupons were not readily available and the program created
``widespread confusion,'' according to the reports.
   The corn meal subsidy program is aimed at reducing state food
subsidies, but so far it has been plagued by coupon shortages and
administrative inefficiency.
   Under the program, eligible families receive free coupons to help
them buy corn meal at state-designated shops. It replaces a broader
subsidy program that was scrapped in response to demands by the
International Monetary Fund.

<HEAD>Court Approves Soccer Stadium That Ultra-Orthodox Jews Oppose</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way
for construction of a soccer stadium in Jerusalem, a move opposed by
ultra-Orthodox Jews who fear weekend games will desecrate the
Sabbath.
   The ruling, which orders the Interior Ministry to sign the
building permit, ended a 15-year battle to get the athletic field
built, according to the office of Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek.
   Kollek hailed the decision as a victory for Jerusalem's youth,
who must travel to the coastal city of Jaffa to see Betar Jerusalem,
the team with the largest following.
   Kollek, along with liberal parliament member Dedi Zucker and a
group of sports fans, filed the petition to the high court a year
and a half ago.
   ``I share the happiness of the residents and sports fans of the
capital,'' Kollek said in a statement.
   He said the stadium would be built ``as soon as possible,''
adding: ``September's soccer season will open in a new stadium.''
   Construction has been blocked by the Interior Ministry, which
refused to sign the building permit despite approval for the arena
from all necessary local government and planning authorities.
   The ministry, which traditionally is headed by an Orthodox
minister, argued that noise from the stadium and its parking lot
could disrupt religious Jews on the Sabbath, which begins at sundown
Friday and continues until sundown Saturday.
   The religious also argued that building the stadium would
encourage Jews to break the Sabbath by driving to see games.
   Most soccer games in Israel are played on Saturday.
   Interior Ministry Spokeswoman Tova Elinson said there would be no
comment on the ruling until the minister, Arye Deri, returned from
the United States on Tuesday.
   The 12,000-seat stadium is to be built in the Malha neighborhood
in southwestern Jerusalem. Many residents of the Bayit Vagan
neighborhood to the north are Orthodox Jews.
   The site has a grass playing field but no seating and no parking
facilities. Construction is expected to cost about $24 million.
   Zucker, a member of the left-leaning Citizens Rights Party,
described the ruling as a victory for secular Jews. He noted 18
months ago ``we opened the town for theaters and movies on Fridays,
and now we have given the town what it is entitled to have, like any
other city in Israel, a stadium.''

<TEXT>
   The Central State Archive has opened 500,000 secret
files on such subjects as the Russian Orthodox Church and the White
Guard opposition to Bolshevik Revolution, Tass said Monday.
   Records on organizations ``liquidated'' during the 1920s and
1930s, at the height of the Stalinist repression, are being
declassified, the official news agency said.
   The government has opened a number of long-closed records to
historians in the past year.
   ``Specialists'' may now view documents of the czarist secret
police, jails and courts, Tass said. It did not define
``specialists.''
   The news agency also said ``a provision has been set'' for
reviewing documents of the Soviet Union's prosecutor's office, its
Supreme Court, the Ministry of Health, the state publishing
committee, and the central council of trade unions. That seemed to
imply that some restrictions would remain.
   The White Guards opposed the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 and
fought the Red Army in a civil war that ended in 1922 when the last
Whites were ousted from Vladivostok.
   Tass did not define the ``liquidated'' organizations covered in
the files, but dictator Josef Stalin was responsible for the deaths
of millions of his people during the 1930s. He wiped out the small
businesses of the New Economic Policy era, a class of independent
farmers called kulaks, and various groups he considered political
opponents.
   Central State Archive Director Boris Kaptelov said the changes
will broaden the base for social sciences.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to study the
power of judges to impose harsher sentences on defendants who back
out of plea-bargain agreements.
   The justices said they will consider reinstating the life
sentence of an Alabama man convicted of burglary. Before standing
trial in 1986, James Lewis Smith had pleaded guilty to the burglary
charge and had been sentenced to 30 years in prison for it.
   Smith had been indicted in Montgomery on charges of rape,
burglary and sodomy _ all arising from the same incident. In a
plea-bargain agreement, he pleaded guilty to rape and burglary, and
the sodomy charge was dropped.
   Smith was sentenced to 30 years on each of the two counts, with
the sentences to run concurrently.
   He then sought to withdraw his guilty plea, and a state appeals
court allowed him to do so. It ruled that Smith had not been
informed that he would be sentenced as a repeat offender, and would
be subject to stiffer penalties than he expected.
   Smith stood trial, was convicted and then was sentenced by the
same state judge who had earlier accepted his plea bargain.
   The judge sentenced Smith to separate life terms for the sodomy
and burglary convictions, and to 150 years for the rape conviction.
   A state appeals court upheld the life terms for sodomy and
burglary, but set aside the sentence for Smith's rape conviction.
   The Alabama Supreme Court last June 24 threw out Smith's life
sentence on the burglary conviction, ruling that it represented
judicial vindictiveness.
   ``It is clear that the trial judge increased (Smith's) sentence
because of his subjective observations and not because of any
objective evidence of events subsequent to (Smith's) first
conviction,'' the state said.
   The June ruling did not affect Smith's life sentence for the
sodomy conviction.
   State Attorney General Don Siegelman appealed the Alabama Supreme
Court ruling, asking the nation's highest court to draw a
distinction between cases in which defendants withdraw guilty pleas
and those in which they are resentenced after successful appeals.
   The Supreme Court in 1969 limited judges' power to impose more
stringent sentences after defendants successfully appealed their
original prison terms.
   The current case is Alabama vs. Smith, 88-333.

<TEXT>
   Iran's hard-line prosecutor general said Monday
more drug traffickers will be executed in a nationwide
anti-narcotics campaign, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
   More than 1,000 people have been arrested and scores have been
killed in gunfights during recent weeks of the crackdown.
   ``We have no fear of increasing statistics on executions because
those who become the victims of death traders are far greater in
number than the smugglers,'' IRNA quoted Prosecutor General Mohammad
Mousavi Khoeniha as saying.
   He was addressing a Tehran seminar on enforcing new laws that
take effect Jan. 21. They impose a mandatory death sentence on
anyone caught carrying an ounce or more heroin, morphine, codeine or
methadone, or smuggling more than 11 pounds of any narcotic.
   Iran's official media reported 19 convicted drug traffickers were
executed Friday and Saturday in Tehran and other cities.
   Khoeniha emerged as a hardliner in the 1979 revolution. He
advocated mass execution of opposition members and was mentor of
militants who seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in November 1979 and
held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.

<TEXT>
   Americans must look to the government _ not the
private sector _ to meet their long-term health care needs through a
comprehensive program financed with increased taxes, a national
consumer group said Monday.
   In an analysis of the growing long-term care problem facing the
nation and the major proposals in Congress to address it, Consumers
Union recommends creation of a universal insurance program funded
with taxes and premiums.
   Consumers Union's criticism of private long-term health care
insurance is based on a survey last May by Consumer Reports, the
group's product-testing publication. But the Health Insurance
Association of America said the policies that were rated by the
publication were old and are not representative of those being
offered today.
   Consumers Union outlined proposals for a basic program at four
federal spending levels, ranging up to $50 billion _ far more than
the state and federal governments now spend on long-term care _ and
said that even the more expensive proposals don't have to worsen the
federal deficit.
   Revenue options include increasing the Social Security payroll
tax, establishing a broad-based payroll tax for long-term care,
imposing an income tax surcharge, increasing gift and estate taxes,
raising alcohol or gasoline excise taxes and requiring payment of
premiums.
   ``We should not let the budget deficit be used as an excuse for
no action or inappropriate action,'' said Gail Shearer, author of
the report.
   Part of the problem, the report says, is the growing cost of
long-term care financed through Medicaid, which diverts funds needed
to provide acute health care to the poor.
   Also, current policies force people to ``spend down'' their
assets and income to qualify for Medicaid benefits. With annual
nursing home charges averaging about $26,000 per resident, a
condition Consumers Union calls ``long-term care-induced poverty''
comes quickly for many.
   Also, people who care for family members at home often can get
little or no paid assistance, resulting in financial, physical and
emotional strain on the caregiver, the report said.
   The private insurance industry is ``incapable'' of solving the
problem, the report said. Too often companies reject applicants with
higher than average health risks, and policies are expensive,
costing up to $100 per month for a 65-year-old and more for older
applicants, the report said.
   Many policies restrict benefits for more expensive custodial care
and require prior hospitalization before paying benefits while few
policies protect against inflation, Consumers Union said.
   ``Private insurance is unlikely to be available to people at high
risk and will remain unaffordable by most people,'' the report said.
   But Susan Van Gelder, associate director of policy development
and research at the insurance association, said most policies issued
in the last six months have eliminated many of the restrictions in
the old policies and most now recognize inflation.
   Long-term care, according to the definition used in the Consumers
Union report, is the help ``needed to cope, and sometimes survive,
when physical or mental disabilities impair the capacity to perform
the basic activities of everyday life, such as eating, toileting,
bathing, dressing and moving about.''
   The federal government in 1987 spent about $11.1 billion on care
in skilled nursing facilities and intermediate-care facilities, and
states added $8.9 billion for these services, according to HHS.
Figures for 1988 were not available, the department said.
   Consumers Union said its ``low option'' would cost an additional
$10 billion in federal money, which would be spent primarily to
finance a comprehensive home health care program for people of all
ages. It also would include a voluntary long-term care policy for
nursing home coverage.
   A $20 billion program could include comprehensive home health
care benefits as well as nursing home coverage for the first six
months of care and a voluntary insurance program for long-term
nursing home stays _ a benefits package similar to that proposed by
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   The group's $50 billion plan would include the elements of the
previous option with expanded nursing home care benefits.

   Libya's foreign minister said today the United
States has launched ``vile campaigns'' against Libya while helping
Israel build a stockpile of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
   Foreign Minister Jadallah Azouz Ettalhi also said U.S.
allegations Libya has a plant intended to build chemical weapons are
``clearly false.''
   Earlier, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said
evidence shown him by Secretary of State George Shultz did not prove
the U.S. allegations.
   Addressing an international conference on chemical weapons,
Ettalhi said the U.S. position on chemical weapons is discriminatory.
   ``How can any member of the international community proclaim a
right it denies others, and how can it stand in the way of
international efforts at eradicating these weapons while, at the
same time, launching vile campaigns of calumny on the basis of a
discriminatory, racist position, basing itself on accusations which
are clearly false,'' he said.
   The Libyan minister claimed Israel has nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons stockpiles and that the United States provides
financing and technical assistance.
   ``This power (the United States) doesn't hesitate to aggress the
victim. This situation is dangerous,'' Ettalhi said. ``Agreed
international rules must be applied to all parties without
discrimination.''
   The five-day conference, which began Saturday, was called to
bolster flagging talks on a chemical weapons ban.
   The United States and the Soviet Union are the only two countries
to admit possessing chemical weapons. According to U.S. estimates,
about 20 countries possess or have the ability to manufacture
chemical weapons.
   The only existing document on chemical weapons, the 1925 Geneva
Protocol, bans only their use, and without enforcement power, is
regarded as inadequate by many nations.
   Vice Premier Tariq Aziz of Iraq led a move Sunday against a ban
on chemical arms unless nuclear weapons are also banned. He said
Israel has ``nuclear weapons as well as chemical weapons and
missiles that can reach many Arab cities.''
   Israel called the Iraqi statement ``blatant hypocrisy.'' Iraq is
known to have used chemical weapons in its 8-year war with Iran.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Israel today accused Iraq, Libya
and Syria of having chemical arms, telling conference delegates that
these weapons have been used ``by countries that made no attempt to
hide or disguise their hostility to Israel.''
   Shultz met Shevardnadze on Sunday and said he had won a promise
from the Soviets to conduct their own inquiry into the plant at
Rabta, south of Tripoli. He said at the time he believed the Soviets
ultimately would back the U.S.
   Libya has denied its plant can make chemical weapons, claiming it
is intended to produce pharmaceuticals.
   ``The American secretary of state showed me the building plan,
but that proves nothing,'' Shevardnadze told reporters today just
before leaving Paris for Moscow.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
Shultz had given Shevardnadze limited information only to show the
information was ``detailed and serious.''
   ``In response, the foreign minister indicated the Soviets took
these issues seriously and would be looking into it and asking
questions,'' Redman said. ``That's what's important.''
   Shevardnadze told reporters he had told Shultz that ``the most
important thing is to stabilize the situation after the air
incident'' during which American fighters shot down two Libyan
warlanes over the Mediterranean last week.
   On Sunday, the Soviet Union announced it would start destroying
chemical arms stockpiles. U.S. officials said the Soviets were
merely playing ``catch-up'' because the United States has been
routinely destroying stockpiles of aging chemical arms since the
early 1980s.
   Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union will not wait for disarmament
negotiators in Geneva to reach an accord banning use, production and
stockpiling of chemical arms. He said a new Soviet facility to
destroy chemical weapons will go into operation this year.
   The envoy said his country has stopped production of chemical
weapons, an announcement first made in April 1987.
   Lynn Hansen, director ofthe bureau of multilateral affairs at the
U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said the Soviet position
``now corresponds to our own position. ... We simply don't get the
press, because for us it's more routine.
   ``When they do it, all of a sudden it's news,'' Hansen told
reporters.
   The United States halted production of chemical weapons in 1969
but resumed 18 years later to counter the Soviet build-up. The
Soviet Union says it has 50,000 tons of chemical arms stockpiled,
while the United States has about 30,000 tons. Both figures are
thought to be largely underestimated.

<HEAD>Newspaper Raises Questions about Death of Plant Worker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Eddie McClary was found dead in two
feet of fermenting mash at a gasohol plant nearly nine years ago,
the case was ruled an accidental drowning and his boss collected
$50,000 in life insurance.
   Now an investigation by the The State newspaper of Columbia has
turned up suggestions that McClary may have been murdered. Among
other things, the newspaper reported a statement by Williamsburg
County Sheriff's Deputy Daniel N. Blunt Sr. _ which he has since
disavowed _ that he had a suspect in the case.
   McClary, 23, was found dead March 3, 1980, in a tank at the
Carolina Alcohol Co. plant in Kingstree, where he was head chemist.
The plant, designed to produce ethanol for an alternative to
gasoline known as gasohol, was owned by state Rep. B.J. Gordon, a
longtime political power in the area.
   Although relatives and rescue workers were suspicious, a
coroner's inquest ruled the case an accident, and Gordon collected
$50,000 from a policy protecting the company against the death of a
key employee. The plant later folded and the Farmers Home
Administration, which backed $420,000 in loans for the project,
footed the bill, The State reported in its stories on the case
published Jan. 1.
   Blunt concluded at the time that McClary's death was an accident,
as did state and federal authorities. The latter two said the scope
of their investigations was limited by the rulings from local
authorities, The State reported. Blunt told the newspaper his own
investigation was curtailed because he resigned his deputy's post to
run for sheriff, an election he lost.
   The newspaper said Gordon testified the next year as a character
witness for Blunt while the officer was on trial on charges of
official corruption, including taking bribes. Blunt was convicted
but pardoned by the state parole board in 1983 and rehired by
Sheriff Theodore McFarlin, who said he was his best investigator.
   According to The State, Blunt told reporters he had always been
suspicious about McClary's death and still had a suspect, although
he refused to identify him. ``A lot of things about this case bother
me,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.
   Specifically, the newspaper said Blunt acknowledged that during
his investigation he didn't ask how McClary had scaled the
10-foot-tall fermentation tank without a ladder, didn't question
cuts and bruises on the body, and didn't try to find out how a grown
man could have fallen through a small hatch atop the tank and
drowned in 24 inches of mash.
   After the stories appeared in The State, Blunt told The News and
Courier of Charleston that he had been misquoted.
   ``Ain't nobody murdered that boy. The State reporters asked me if
there was anything suspicious. I said a lawman's always suspicious.
That doesn't mean I suspect murder in this case,'' Blunt told the
Charleston paper.
   The State's managing editor, Robert Hitt, said the newspaper
stood by its story. He said that although the interview with Blunt
was not taped, the two reporters present took extensive notes.
   The State said its stories were based on a seven-month
examination of more than 3,000 pages of state and federal records,
some obtained through use of the Freedom of Information Act.
   Hugh Munn, a spokesman for the State Law Enforcement Division,
said Blunt denied having a suspect when he spoke to agents from his
department last week.
   Munn said his agency also questioned several other people ``but
there was no new evidence, so there's nothing more we can do.''
   McFarlin, the Williamsburg sheriff, said last week he did not
plan to reopen the case. Mark Dillard, a spokesman for state
Attorney General Travis Medlock, said his office had examined the
newspaper's report but found nothing to warrant further action.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell said he supported the decision not to
officially reopen the case. ``I have to trust the law enforcement
officials,'' Campbell said.
   Tommy Gamble, one of the rescue workers who pulled McClary's body
from the vat, said he was interviewed Tuesday by three law
enforcement division agents. Gamble said he told the agents that he
would ``die and go to hell 40 times before they'd make me believe he
died in an accident.''
   Lichi Boggs, McClary's mother, said she remains convinced her son
was murdered. ``If I had millions of dollars to prove it, I would
fight it to the end,'' she said.
   Gordon, after repeatedly refusing calls and visits by State
reporters, told The Associated Press he has suffered greatly from
McClary's death.
   ``I suffered a lot of pain from that business venture. I suffered
pain from the loss of a friend. ... I feel sorry for people who
forever try to open wounds and bring about pain.''
   Gordon gained national attention last year when he and state Sen.
Frank McGill filed charges of criminal libel against newspaper
editor Jim Fitts. Fitts was arrested and spent a weekend in jail
after he wrote a column critical of the two men. Gordon and McGill,
who has since died, later dropped the charges.

<HEAD>Census Slated For Whopping Decennial Budget Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While most federal agencies are struggling with
funding cuts or small raises, the Census Bureau would get nearly
triple its current amount under President Reagan's 1990 budget.
   But don't get too excited, it's only temporary.
   Reagan proposed Census Bureau spending of $1.47 billion for
fiscal 1990, up from about $250 million in 1988 and about $559
million in the current year.
   The reason is the ``decennial'' census.
   The Constitution requires the bureau to count all residents of
the United States every 10 years. The next count will be conducted
April 1, 1990.
   That requires opening dozens of offices across the country,
mailing out more than 100 million census forms, sending an army of
people to the thousands of homes where folks fail to respond, and
compiling the tidal wave of data to be collected.
   Overall, the 1990 national head count is expected to cost $2.6
billion, but not all in one year. The costs are spread over several
years because of the lengthy preparation of forms and maps and
offices and computers.

   Stormie Jones, the world's first recipient of a
simultaneous heart and liver transplant, was in good condition after
she returned to Pittsburgh to determine if her liver is working
properly.
   Stormie, 11, of White Settlement, Texas, was accompanied by her
mother, Lois Purcell, officials of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh
said Monday.
   Blood tests in Texas found elevated levels of body toxins the
liver should be removing, said hospital spokeswoman Lynn McMahon.
   Doctors performed Stormie's pioneering transplant operation at
Children's Hospital in February 1984 because she suffered from
hyper-cholesterolemia, which causes great amounts of fat to
accumulate in the blood.
   She returned last October for bile duct reconstruction and was
discharged in early December. Miss McMahon said it was not
immediately clear whether her new symptoms are related to the bile
duct problem.

<DATELINE>RADNOR, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush could use a
``Department of Television Strategy'' on his transition team, former
President Richard Nixon said in a magazine article released Monday.
   ``Ronald Reagan used TV so skillfully that he made it look
effortless,'' Nixon wrote in the Jan. 14 issue of TV Guide. ``It
would be a mistake for any other president to assume he will do as
well. Reagan was born to the breed, a performer long before he
became a politician.''
   Nixon, whose own career included such effective television
performances as the ``Checkers speech,'' and such disasters as the
1960 Kennedy-Nixon debate, lamented that the Bush transition team
didn't include a television division.
   ``Of all the institutions arrayed with and against a president,
none controls his fate more than television,'' he wrote. ``Unless a
president learns how to harness its power, his administration is in
trouble from the very beginning.''
   Newspapers are important, Nixon wrote, ``but only if their work
is picked up and amplified by TV.''
   ``A newspaper story that turns a few hundred thousand heads in
the morning can turn 40-plus million that evening if the networks
use it. Otherwise, it is usually gone with the wind,'' he wrote.
   ``Most TV reporters, like most politicians, are conscientious,
intelligent and hard-working. The majority are liberal. But because
of the media's loss of credibility in recent years, they are
sensitive about appearing biased,'' Nixon wrote.
   ``This makes them fair-weather friends. Except during the 1981
recession and the Iran-Contra affair, President Reagan got generally
favorable coverage on TV not because the reporters liked him but
because the people did.''

   Actor Gary Busey has left the hospital and
moved to a private rehabilitation facility to continue his recovery
from head injuries suffered in a near-fatal motorcycle crash last
month.
   The actor's family has him ``in an undisclosed facility to
continue his rehab work,'' Ron Wise, a Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
spokesman, said Monday. ``They want privacy.''
   Busey was in fair condition and ``seemed to be doing well,'' when
he left Friday, Wise said.
   Wise said the prognosis for a full recovery still holds up.
   All inquiries were referred to Busey publicist Paul Bloch, who
didn't immediately return calls Monday.
   Busey, 44, an active opponent of mandatory helmet laws, wasn't
wearing a helmet Dec. 4 when he lost control of his motorcycle in
Culver City, fell and hit the back of his head on a curb. He
underwent 90 minutes of neurosurgery.
   Busey, whose movie credits include ``Big Wednesday,'' ``Carney''
and ``Lethal Weapon,'' was nominated for an Academy Award for the
title role in ``The Buddy Holly Story.'' Most recently, he portrayed
a journalist in the HBO miniseries ``A Dangerous Life.''

<HEAD>U.S Suspends Direct Export Loans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Export-Import Bank on Monday stopped
offering direct loans to foreign governments for purchasing U.S.
goods, reflecting President Reagan's desire to terminate the program
next fiscal year.
   Reagan, in his proposed budget for fiscal 1990, said he wants to
convert the direct loans into a guaranteed loan program. Last year
the government issued more than $207 million worth of loans to
finance purchases of U.S. exports.
   The bank said it will continue its $11 billion program for
guaranteeing such loans by private banks.
   Most of the loans have gone to Third World counties, whose total
debt has risen largely in recent years _ much of through their
failure to pay interest due on the loans.
   Spokesman Hal Sundstrom said Exim's board of directors acted at a
meeting Friday.
   ``In the real world, tough choices have to be made in order to
reduce our national budget deficit,'' Exim Bank president John A.
Bohn, Jr. said in a statement Monday.
   Reagan's budget proposal would keep a $100 million ``war chest''
for directo loans to compete with subsidized loans granted by other
industrial governments. It proposed $10.567 billion for guarantees
next year, down from $11 billion this year.
   As of Dec. 22, the bank had guaranteed $239 million worth of
private bank loans, Sundstrom said. The guarantees also encourage
U.S. exports by allowing banks to make loans to the borrowing
country on easier terms _ lower interest rates and longer repayment
periods.
   Reagan has tried to cut the direct loans before, but Congress has
voted the money anyway.
   The suspension of new loans will last ``until the 1990 Eximbank
loan budget situation clarifies,'' the bank said in a statement.

<TEXT>
   A nurse's colleagues jokingly called
her ``Angel of Death'' because elderly patients kept dying during
her shift. Now, she is going on trial, charged with killing 17
patients in a two-year period.
   Michaela Roeder admits giving the fatal doses to six of the
patients, and says she did it to spare them pain. But prosecutor
Karl Hermann Majorowsky alleges she did it just as a ``demonstration
of her power.''
   ``The accused posed as a mistress over life and death. We are
dealing here with cold-blooded murder out of base motives,'' a Jan.
9 issue of Der Spiegel magazine quoted Majorowsky as saying.
   Ms. Roeder's murder trial begins Tuesday in district court in
Wuppertal, about 37 miles north of Bonn. She faces a possible
sentence of life in prison if convicted.
   The accusations against Ms. Roeder, 30, have absorbed the West
German press, who have called the alleged killings ``nearly the
perfect murder'' because they went almost unnoticed by police.
   On a tip from a hospital employee, authorities had the bodies of
28 deceased former patients of the intensive care unit at St. Petrus
Hospital in Wuppertal exhumed.
   According to court records, the examinations showed that 17 of
the patients had received a ``fatal dose'' of drugs that can
severely affect blood pressure or the heart.
   Ms. Roeder is accused of issuing the fatal injections between
February 1984 and February 1986 while working in the St. Petrus
intensive care section.
   After Ms. Roeder's arrest in March 1986, she admitted to law
officials that she gave fatal injections to six patients because she
wanted to spare them suffering from their ailments. Majorowsky says
in court papers there are ``no clues that these patients would have
died.''
   Most of the 17 patients were elderly and had been brought to the
intensive care section after operations for ailments ranging from
appendicitis to cancer, according to news reports. The oldest victim
was 94, according to the reports.
   The official cause of death for the 17 patients was heart or
circulatory failure, the reports said.
   Ms. Roeder began working at the hospital in 1978 and was jokingly
dubbed the ``Angel of Death'' by her colleagues when elderly
patients under her care started dying, according to Der Spiegel.
   ``They didn't call Michaela Roeder the `Angel of Death' because
they suspected foul play,'' the magazine wrote. ``The little joke in
this name was meant to help console her over her bad luck and these
unfortunate coincidences.''
   The magazine said Majorowsky is expected to have difficulty
proving murder against Ms. Roeder.
   ``The weak point of the charge is the motive brought against the
defendant. Killing in order to demonstrate power, to feel that she
was a mistress over life or death?,'' the magazine asked
rhetorically.
   Der Spiegel said the trial will likely investigate whether Ms.
Roeder may have been unable to withstand the stress and demands of
working in an intensive care unit. More than 40 witnesses and
medical experts are expected to testify.
   If there is insufficient evidence for premeditated murder, Ms.
Roeder could be found guilty of manslaughter, which carries a
minimum sentence of five years in prison.

   The Kremlin's earthquake relief commission sharply
criticized two Armenian ministries Monday for failing to provide
plans for schooling, jobs and shelter to tens of thousands of
survivors.
   The Politburo commission said most government agencies have
finished detailed proposals for restoring normal life in the section
of northwest Armenia devastated by the Dec. 7 quake, Tass reported.
The earthquake killed 24,888 people and left 500,000 homeless.
   But the Armenian ministry of light industry was censured because
it did not produce ``specific proposals for the employment of 40,000
people and for improvement in their living conditions,'' the
official news agency said.
   About 80,000 children remain in the disaster area, but the
Armenian ministry of public education ``has taken practically no
serious steps to organize their upbringing and instruction,'' Tass
said.
   The Soviet ministry of railways, however, was praised for
developing plans to double the freight hauled on Armenia's two main
lines to 40 million tons a year, the report said. Transport
officials earlier came under strong criticism as thousands of
railcars packed with relief supplies piled up at stations and on
side tracks for lack of sufficient labor to unload them.
   The first priority goals of reconstruction of housing complexes,
industry, agricultural facilities and city and town buildings are
proceeding and should be finalized within two weeks, Tass said.
Authorities have pledged to rebuild within two years.
   The first foundation stone for a new apartment house was laid
Saturday in Leninakan, where more than 200 buildings were destroyed.

<HEAD>Palm Beach County Pours Chlorinated Waste Into The Ocean</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKE WORTH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palm Beach County dumped a million
gallons of chlorinated raw sewage from an affluent suburb into the
Atlantic Ocean rather than let it spill onto property and into
canals.
   ``The two alternatives were not very attractive,'' said Health
Department engineering director Frank Gargiulo. ``One was
discharging sewage on the ground. The other was discharging it into
the ocean.''
   Health department officials banned swimming, surfing and wading
on 13 miles of beach from Singer Island to Lantana for about 24
hours.
   The problem started with the shutdown of a regional treatment
plant early Sunday to bring a new section on line.
   ``This was a planned event,'' Gargiulo said. ``At night, they
don't generate as much sewage.''
   But Lake Worth produced more waste than expected. By 2 a.m.,
officials were worried about it spilling and seeping onto the ground.
   For about three hours, waste flowed from a pumping station
through a pipe that extends about a mile into the Atlantic Ocean,
officials said.
   Dumping raw waste there is illegal, but Gargiulo described the
step as ``the lesser of two evils.''
   Don White, a state Department of Environmental Regulation
official, was present when the waste was discharged. ``They had
emergency approval from us,'' he said Monday.
   ``Up until 25 to 30 years ago, all of the domestic waste from the
Lake Worth area was discharged through that outflow,'' he said,
``but it has not been used for 25 years routinely.''
   White said he didn't know what effect the chlorinated sewage
would have on marine life at the discharge point.
   Gargiulo said the action is not expected to cause health problems.
   ``The ocean is usually a hostile environment for bacteria,'' he
said. ``There is a high salt content and strong currents. We're very
confident that tidal activity during the 24-hour (ban) will cleanse
the area.''
   Some beachgoers seemed equally unconcerned.
   Despite red ``no swimming'' flags, Julio Armas, 26, of West Palm
Beach, took a blue raft into the ocean.
   He said the water probably has been polluted on other days. ``We
just happened to know about it this time,'' he said.

<HEAD>Proposed U.S. Defense Spending Under NATO Guidelines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration's plans for a
small increase in military spending may hurt efforts to get European
allies to pay a greater share of the common defense, analysts say.
   ``This will create some tensions,'' said Hans Binnendijk,
director of studies for the London-based International Institute for
Strategic Studies.
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci asked Congress to boost defense
spending by an inflation-adjusted 2 percent for the next two years
in the draft military budget. He proposed $315.2 billion in budget
authority for 1990, and $330.89 billion for 1991.
   The spending plans, however, will likely be modified after George
Bush assumes the presidency.
   There has been growing criticism in the U.S. Congress in recent
years that America's allies in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization are not shouldering enough of the burden of financing a
common defense. NATO defense ministers in December released a report
on the ``burden-sharing'' issue and faulted some in the 16-nation
Western alliance for not doing enough.
   In the late 1970s, the United States began pressing for an
inflation-adjusted 3 percent annual increase in each country's
defense spending, a sum that has become a rough guideline for
measuring military expenditures.
   Martin McCusker, director of the military committee of the North
Atlantic Assembly, said the draft budget plan ``will certainly blunt
the argument that some will make now _ that some Europeans are not
even keeping up with the minimum 3 percent.''
   ``It will show the United States is not reaching that level
either,'' he said. The assembly is made up of legislators who
represent the NATO countries.
   A spokesman for the U.S. mission to NATO said, ``Budgetary
constraints have required the proposal for only a 2 percent
increase.''
   ``Given the long-standing burden-sharing issue, the United States
would nonetheless hope that those countries which have not met past
goals would not use this as an excuse for lowering their budget
projections,'' said the spokesman, who demanded anonymity.
   The NATO report on burden-sharing said that on average in the
past decade, Canada, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain, Turkey,
Britain and the United States generally met the 3 percent goal.
   Belgium, Denmark, Germany and Greece posted the smallest average
growth levels, it said.
   ``Although some countries have improved performance in the last
five years (Canada, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Turkey and
the United States), performance in general has been somewhat less
successful and this downward trend generally seems set to
continue,'' it said.
   Binnendijk said that although Carlucci wants a 2 percent pickup
in military spending, ``the reality is they are not going to get any
real increase.''
   ``Because of the budget constraints on Capitol Hill ... the best
the Pentagon can hope for is a straight line in real terms. Growth
of 2 percent is highly unlikely,'' he said.
   Indeed, Congress has trimmed the Pentagon's wish list in recent
years.
   It approved a 1.3 percent inflation-adjusted decrease in budget
authority in the current 1989 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. The
administration had presented a budget proposal of $299.5 billion
under a compromise money plan worked out with Congress. That
proposed spending level was not large enough to offset inflation.
   Congressionally approved budget authority was off 2 percent in
1988, 3.7 percent in 1987 and 4.4 percent in 1986. It soared 7.6
percent in 1985, which had marked the sixth straight year of
increases.
   NATO's European members have responded to the U.S. push for more
military money with figures showing their total defense spending
skyrocketed 34 percent, after adjustment for inflation, between 1970
and 1987. U.S. spending, in contrast, was up 15 percent over the
same period.
   Per capital defense spending, according to these figures, grew 21
percent in the European countries over the 1970-86 period, compared
with a 3 percent decline in the United States. Military manpower
advanced 5 percent in Europe over 1970-87, compared with a 31
percent decline in the United States, according to the European
figures.

   President Reagan said Monday that his proposed
$1.15 trillion spending blueprint for fiscal 1990 puts America ``on
track to a balanced budget'' and eventually ``a modest surplus.''
   Appearing before a group of business leaders, Reagan defended his
budget proposal, which calls for deficit spending of $92.5 billion,
as ``an excellent document that fulfills the original objectives''
of meeting basic needs without tax rate hikes.
   ``We even do this without touching Social Security, weakening our
national defense or reducing benefits to the needy ... and we do
this without raising taxes,'' said Reagan.
   The president, who underwent weekend surgery on his left ring
finger, appeared with his hand heavily bandaged.
   Reagan said that ``thanks to our record (economic) expansion, the
revenue is literally rolling in.''
   ``Raising taxes would be the surest way of killing the economic
goose that lays the golden egg,'' the president told some 150 men
and women gathered in an auditorium of the Old Executive Office
Building next to the White House.
   Reagan and White House chief of staff Kenneth M. Duberstein told
the group they would not be surprised to see opposition in Congress
to some of the administration's proposals for eliminating various
federal programs.
   ``There are some people on Capitol Hill who are already saying,
`Dead on arrival,''' Duberstein said, ``but those people simply
don't like hearing the message that this last budget of Ronald
Reagan proclaims.''
   Of his critics, Reagan said, ``Basically, what they really want
is to repudiate the last eight years and repeal the last election,''
in which Vice President George Bush defeated Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis.
   Reagan again denounced what he said was an ``iron triangle'' of
congressional Democrats, special interest groups and the news media,
which he predicted would be ready with ``a fiscal sob story'' aimed
at undermining support for Reagan's budget.
   He said that critics will say that ``revenue is scare here in
Washington, and there isn't enough money to go around,'' and told
his listeners that would be a ``flim flam story.''
   Reagan said that his final budget proposal ``places America on
track to a balanced budget, and even a modest surplus, by 1993.''

   The fire at the Ali Aga refinery started in the unit that
produces bottled gas for kitchen use, according to the semi-official

   Zekeriya Oral, deputy director of the state-owned company that

   When the Rouse Co. designed the community of
Columbia 21 years ago, no one thought about endings, just beginnings.
   Now, with a population that has grown to 70,500, the community
built on farm land halfway between Baltimore and Washington are
about to be offered a place to be buried.
   Later this month, grave sites will go on sale for Columbia's
first cemetery, a development that marks the community's coming of
age, according to Jerry Brock, vice president of senior development
at Rouse.
   ``It represents the fact that it's an established community. It's
no longer a new town or an experiment,'' Brock said.
   The Rouse Co. began thinking about a cemetery for Columbia in the
late 1970s, but only in the past few years has Columbia's population
reached a point to make a cemetery financially possible, Brock said.
   Last year, Rouse officials sold 28 acres to Harvey Geller, 58, a
semi-retired Bethesda resident with more than 30 years managing
cemeteries in Massachusetts, Virginia and Pennsylvania.
   ``This is the first time I've ever started one brand new,''
Geller said. ``It's a labor of love.''
   A stone wall at the entrance has been built, five acres of wooded
land have been cleared, and shrubs have been planted at the 28-acre
cemetery.
   The cemetery should hold about 25,000 graves, enough to supply
Columbia's needs for about 50 years, Geller said.

   Sigma Alpha Epsilon has a new house on
Fraternity Row at the University of Mississippi after being
suspended last fall when one of its pledges was charged with rape.
   The fraternity was allowed to move into the house over the
weekend, Associate Dean of Students Sparky Reardon said.
   University officials said the social organization had been
suspended for exhibiting a ``chronic disregard for existing rules
and guidelines.''
   University officials said an investigation revealed the
fraternity had served alcohol at an unsanctioned party with Chi
Omega sorority at the Oxford Country Club on Sept. 23. Questions
about the party arose after a freshman pledge, Stover L. Smith III
of Metarie, La., was charged with rape in an alleged attack on a Chi
Omega pledge.
   Smith, who has since withdrawn from school, recently pleaded
innocent. No trial date was set, and he was freed on $50,000 bond.
   Reardon said the fraternity appealed to the dean of students for
reinstatement and received approval to return to campus. All
privileges were restored.
   ``Their national organization and their alumni had done a great
deal of work in rectifying the situation and we're satisfied that
they have done all we asked them to,'' Reardon said.

<HEAD>South Florida Enters Commuter Train Age</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 1,600 passengers climbed aboard the
green-and-white cars of the Tri-Rail commuter line Monday, eager to
take part in the first day of regular service on south Florida's new
commuter train.
   ``It's beyond our expectations,'' Broward County Commissioner Ed
Kennedy said of initial response to the train line, which runs
between West Palm Beach and Miami. ``Our objective is to hold those
who rode it and build on that.''
   Kennedy, chairman of the Tri-County Commuter Rail Organization,
said passenger totals should grow as communities improve bus
connections and traffic worsens on Interstate 95.
   The 67-mile train line was born as an answer to traffic problems
expected during almost five years of planned construction to widen
I-95 between Boca Raton and Miami.
   But officials hope it will become popular enough to survive
beyond that.
   The federal government provided 90 percent of the $118 million
needed for the trains, with the state and local governments picking
up the rest. Federal transportation officials are carefully watching
the project, the largest of several in the nation using existing
Amtrak or freight tracks to create commuter lines.
   The track record on mass transit in South Florida is not good.
Metrorail, a $1 billion elevated railway system in Dade County, has
failed to attract many riders.
   Commuter Bill Morgan said he was riding because ``the drivers in
South Florida are the worst I've ever known.''
   Adam White, a commuter who boarded in Palm Beach County, said
riding the train ``is less stressful. You can think more ... plan
the week more.''
   Kennedy said he hopes to see the daily passenger total grow to
14,000 in three years.
   He said he knew of only two problems Monday morning: a
malfunctioning switch that delayed a train 20 minutes; and a 20 mph
speed limit on a stretch of track in Dade County that needs to be
lifted.
   Longer range problems include an $800,000 station near the Fort
Lauderdale airport that may be torn down because it is directly
underneath the flight path of planes and a shortage of bus service
to many of the stations.
   No fares will be charged for riding the train until May 1, when a
one-way trip of any length will cost $2.

<HEAD>Reagan Wants New Weapons in Production, More Star Wars Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan offered Congress a Pentagon
budget plan Monday that would move several big-ticket weapons into
production, escalate ``Star Wars'' research and largely sustain U.S.
military force at its current size.
   Reagan requested $315.2 billion in budget authority _ a 2 percent
increase after inflation _ for national defense in fiscal 1990
beginning next Oct. 1. Over the past four years, Congress has
trimmed defense spending increases to levels below the rate of
inflation.
   The defense budget envision that only $303 billion of the $315.2
billion will be paid out during the fiscal year. The balance
represents money that would be authorized for various programs but
not spent until later.
   Of the totals, $305.6 billion in budget authority and $293.8
billion in outlays is earmarked for the Defense Department. The
remainder _ $9.6 billion in budget authority and $9.2 billion in
outlays _ is contained in the Energy Department's budget to cover
nuclear warhead production and research work.
   Reagan's spending plan also includes recommendations for fiscal
1991. He requested $330.8 billion in budget authority then, of which
$314.4 billion would actually be spent during the period.
   President-election Bush is expected to amend Reagan's proposal
after he assumes office. Bush has talked of cutting the request so
that it just matches inflation instead of providing real growth.
   Many of Reagan's priorities, however, are likely to be embraced
by Bush. Reagan's budget, for example, increasing funds for military
recruiting and by proposes 3.6 percent pay raise for those in
uniform, compared with only a 2 percent proposed pay raise for
civilian workers.
   The budget plan also requests $500 million to begin shutting down
unneeded military bases. It would reduce the Defense Department's
civilian workforce of 1.1 million by 5,000 people and shift more
than two dozen existing weapon programs toward multi-year contracts.
   Several of Reagan's defense proposals also are sure to stir
controversy.
   For instance, Reagan wants to scrap development of the
truck-mobile, single-warhead Midgetman nuclear missile, a weapon
favored by some Democratic leaders in Congress.
   His budget also would earmark $94.6 million to start development
of a new anti-satellite weapon that could be deployed at sea.
Congress forced cancellation of such a weapon that would have
operated from land-based jets.
   And Reagan would significantly boost spending on Star Wars
research _ from $4.05 billion this year to $5.9 billion in fiscal
1990 and $7 billion in 1991.
   Bush has said he supports Star Wars research, but it remains
unclear how fast he's willing to pursue it.
   Even with the spending increase, outgoing Defense Secretary Frank
C. Carlucci said the administration had made some hard choices in
setting priorities, either canceling or delaying two dozen programs.
   Most of the affected programs were rather small, but one _ a
proposal to upgrade the Navy's A-6 Intruder attack jet _ would save
$503 million in fiscal 1990.
   ``The moderate 2 percent real growth rate proposed in this budget
is an attempt to steer a sustainable and fiscally responsible course
that allows the United States to maintain its current force
structure and to acquire the weapon systems necessary to ensure our
national security,'' Carlucci said.
   Among the major defense proposals, Reagan urged Congress to:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Move the new B-2 stealth bomber which unveiled just two months
ago into production, along with the Navy's new Trident II
submarine-launched nuclear missile and a rail-mobile version of the
giant MX intercontinental ballistic missile. Also on the nuclear, or
strategic forces, side, the fiscal 1990 budget calls for continued
developed of the Advanced Cruise Missile and construction of another
Trident submarine. The Marine Corps would begin production of the
V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft.
   _Increase active-duty personnel strength slightly by 5,000 in
fiscal 1990 _ up to 2,138,000 _ then adjust it back down by 4,000 in
fiscal 1991. The small swing is needed to help the Navy bring some
new ships on line, the Pentagon said. The reserve forces and
National Guard would increase in strength by 7,600 to 1,178,000.
   _Allow the Navy to increase in size from 568 battle force ships
to 574 by the end of fiscal 1990. That number would decline slightly
to 571 by the end of 1991 with the retirement of old submarines.
However, the fiscal 1990 budget also would allow the Navy to begin
construction of 19 new ships in addition to the new Trident missile
sub.
   _Cut from 36 to 35 the number of Tactical Air Wings in the Air
Force, but maintain the existing size and structure of the Army and
Marine Corps. Readiness training programs would be maintained at
their current level _ Army, Navy and Air Force flying hours per
month and Navy steaming days would not be changed. The Army's tank
training budget, which allows 850 tank miles per year, would be
reduced slightly to 800 miles per year.
   _Maintain for the most part existing production rates for
aircraft. The Army would build both UH-60 Blackhawk transport
helicopters and AH-64 attack choppers at the current rate of 72 a
year. The Marine Corps would continue to buy 24 AV-8B Harrier jets a
year, and the Air Force would continue to purchase 36 F-15 jet
fighters a year. The Air Force's purchases of F-16 fighters would
decline from 180 this year to 150 in 1990, while the Navy would
reduce its purchases of F-A-18 fighters from 84 a year to 72 a year.
The Navy would increase from 12 to 18 the number of either new or
modernized F-14 fighters it buys annually.

   Compass needles don't always point north, a
problem that may be eased by a new series of charts prepared by the
federal government.
   Compasses are oriented by the Earth's magnetic field, and since
that is shifting over time, the direction the needle points changes
also.
   This may mean little to most people, but it can be a serious
problem for engineers, navigators, mapmakers, hikers, scientists and
others who need to know where they are going.
   A person following the compass needle in the Florida panhandle,
for example, would be walking due north.
   But someone following his compass in Maine would be going 21
degrees to the west, while an Alaskan would be heading 35 degrees
east of north.
   The U.S. Geological Survey has compiled a series of 10 new
magnetic charts _ five for the United States and five for the globe
_ showing variances in different areas.
   Because of the time needed to compile these complex maps, the
charts are current for 1985 and contain correction estimates for the
next few years so users can keep current with the changing magnetic
field.
   The United States charts cost $6.20 each and those for the globe
are $3.10 apiece. Ordering information can be obtained from the U.S.

<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Kim Young-sam said
Monday that President Roh Tae-woo must remove and put on trial
senior officials who played key roles in the authoritarian
government of former president Chun Doo-hwan.
   Kim, leader of the Reunification Democratic Party, said South
Korea faces renewed political instability if the government fails to
expose and bring to justice all those involved in corruption and
human rights abuses under Chun.
   ``We need stability. Stability can only be realized through
liquidation of past misdeeds,'' Kim said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
   He said Roh must keep a promise to hold a referendum to give
voters the opportunity to evaluate his performance. Roh made the
promise just before the December 1987 presidential elections.
   ``This is the promise he made to the people,'' Kim said.
   Kim said the nation would not wait indefinitely for a referendum,
but he declined to set any time limits for holding the measure. He
also declined to comment on whether he thought Roh could win a
referendum.
   The government's Democratic Justice Party has said a decision
will be made in the next few months on holding a referendum.
Government officials say they are confident Roh would win a majority.
   Kim cast doubt on Roh's willingness to take necessary action to
expose and punish corruption and human rights abuses under Chun's
rule. He said top Chun aides remained in the government and ruling
party and must be expelled and put on trial.
   He also insisted that former president Chun be made to testify
before the National Assembly inquiry into misdeeds under his
government. But Kim said he opposes jailing Chun because he was once
president.
   Roh had to remove the legacy of the Chun era and proceed against
those guilty of abuses or his government would be rejected by South
Koreans, Kim said. ``The people would never accept or tolerate
anything else,'' he said.
   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in
1980, went into rural exile in November after apologizing to the
nation for abuses under his rule.
   Chun accepted moral responsibility for his government's abuses,
but denied he was involved. A number of Chun's relatives and aides
have been convicted or charged with embezzlement and other crimes.
   Resolving the Chun legacy is the main political challenge facing
South Korea and it had to be resolved soon, Kim said. Failure to
resolve the crisis would threaten political stability, he said.
   The National Assembly resumes its investigation Tuesday into
abuses under Chun's rule. The government is attempting to block
assembly demands that Chun be made to testify before lawmakers.
   Roh, a former ally of Chun, wants to limit the furor over Chun
without damaging his government, which is identified with his
predecessor in the eyes of many Koreans.
   Roh, a former general, defeated Kim Young-sam and rival
opposition leader Kim Dae-jung in presidential elections in
December, 1987 after the two Kims split the opposition vote.

<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syria and Morocco agreed Monday to resume
diplomatic relations after a 30-month break, the two countries
announced.
   An announcement on official Damascus Radio said Syria and Morocco
had decided to act because of ``brotherly mediation'' by Saudi
Arabia to achieve Arab solidarity.
   Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdel-Aziz left Damascus
on Saturday after two days of talks with Syrian President Hafez
Assad and flew to Rabat, Morocco's capital, for talks with Moroccan
leaders.
   ``This decision follows a fraternal initiative undertaken by
Saudi Arabia and is aimed at eliminating obstacles blocking
concentrated Arab action to face up to the dangers that menace the
Arab nation,'' said a communique issued in Rabat.
   Assad severed relations with Rabat July 27, 1986, to protest a
meeting between King Hassan and the then Israel Prime Minister,
Shimon Peres.
   Monday's move raised speculation the Syrians may be moving closer
to ending feuds with its main Arab rivals, Egypt and Iraq.
   Damascus Radio made no mention of those countries, but Abdullah
said before he left Damascus that his talks with Assad had been
aimed at bolstering Arab solidarity.
   He said he discussed Syria's rifts with Morocco, Egypt and Iraq.
   Syria, like most Arab states, severed links with Cairo over the
late President Anwar Sadat's 1979 peace treaty with Israel. An Arab
summit last year gave the green light for Arabs to restore ties with
Cairo.
   Most have done so, but hardline states such as Syria have refused
and blocked moves to readmit Egypt into the 22-member Arab League.
   Syria and Iraq, ruled by rival wings of the Baath Socialist
Party, have been feuding for nearly a decade.
   These rifts have been a major obstacle in the Arab quest for long
elusive unity to confront Israel. Saudi Arabia and Jordan have been
trying for years to reconcile Syria with its rivals.

<HEAD>Ideologue Warns Party Unity In Danger, Rally Banned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities banned a dissident
rally Monday, and the Communisty Party's chief ideologist warned
that right-wing adventurism threatens the party's rule, as it did in
1968.
   The speech by ideologist Jan Fojtik to party ideologues in
western Pilsen town suggested division among communists about how to
proceed amid growing calls for economic and political reforms to
match changes in the Soviet Union.
   Fojtik is among orthodox leaders who have refused to countenance
political reforms or dialogue with increasingly active independent
groups.
   Prague authorities banned a rally called for Sunday by Charter 77
and four other independent groups to commemorate Jan Palach, a Czech
student who burned himself to death in January 1969 to protest the
Warsaw Pact invasion to crush Poland's communist-led reforms.
   Human rights activist Anna Sabatova said the rally will go ahead
in Wenceslas Square despite the ban, which she said was made known
Friday.
   Fojtik's speech attacked independent groups, repeating charges
they are ``manipulated'' by anti-communist centers abroad, but also
expressed doubt about changes elsewhere in the Soviet bloc.
   ``There are voices of dissonance, unusual and unexpected opinions
reflecting not only confusion and uncertainty but sometimes also
extreme positions, including casting doubts over the entire history
of socialism and its claims on the future,'' he said.
   ``Even today we don't have the right to ignore the danger
socialism is in,'' he added, warning communists not to underestimate
``forces willing to ... repeat the right-wing adventure of the late
1960s.''
   In 1968, the Soviets and their supporters charged communist rule
was threatened by Western-backed ``counterrevolution'' and used this
as justification to invade Poland.
   Palach protested the invasion and continuing presence of Soviet
troops on Jan. 16, 1969, by setting himself alight in Wenceslas
Square.
   He died three days later. Thousands of Czechoslovaks, shocked and
moved by his protest, attended his funeral.
   Meanwhile, Ms. Sabatova reported a 37-year-old Communist Party
member died Dec. 3 after he was beaten by police who accused him of
a minor traffic offense.
   In a telephone call to The Associated Press bureau in Vienna, Ms.
Sabatova said an autopsy showed Josef Babka died the following day
from internal bleeding that caused a circulatory collapse. He lived
in Mihalovce, a town in east Slovakia close to the Soviet border.
   Meanwhile, an emigre source in Vienna said the recently formed
Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee has appealed to authorities to allow
a 48-year-old Charter 77 signatory to emigrate to West Germany for
heart surgery.
   So far, authorities have refused permission to Walter Kania.He
was granted an early release from prison last May after he suffered
two heart attacks while serving a 10-year jail term.
   The new committee, which includes prominent activists such as
banned playwright Vaclav Havel, appealed to the Czechoslovak Justice
Ministry on Jan. 5, said the source.

<HEAD>Activists Say 12 Arrested at Christmas Celebration</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soldiers entered a private home in the Armenian
capital Yerevan during a Christmas gathering and arrested 12
activists, including four members of the Karabakh Committee, an
Armenian source said Monday.
   Arpenay Popoyan said in a telephone interview from Yerevan that
the arrests occured Saturday _ Christmas Eve on the Orthodox
Christian calendar.
   Everyone was arrested except the woman who had invited the 12,
she said.
   Four members of the Karabakh Committee, an informal group
agitating for annexation of the Nagorno-Karabakh region from
neighboring Azerbaijan, were arrested along with eight other
Armenian activists.
   Mrs. Popoyan, who is active in the Armenian movement, said that
as of Sunday night, other activists had not yet been able to
determine where they were being held.
   The members of the Karabakh Committee had been in hiding since
some committee members were arrested during President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's visit to the are following the Dec. 7 earthquake.
   They were being held under administrative rules imposed along
with a curfew and military law that allow detention for up to 30
days without formal criminal proceedings.
   Armenians began agitating for annexation of the predominantly
Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh region in February. Tension between the
two republics has erupted into violence in which more than 60 people
have been killed, and thousands have fled the violence.
   Azerbaijan and the central government have rejected Armenia's
demand to annex Nagorno-Karabakh.

<HEAD>Friend's Death Inspires Ad Urging Motorists Not to Drive Drunk</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A filmmaker whose best friend was killed by a
drunken driver turned his grief into a television advertisement that
is a labor of love for a buddy who died a senseless death and the
thousands of others like him.
   ``What we're trying to do is stop people from drinking and
driving,'' Lee Gotfried said Monday. ``We die of enough things in
the world _ disease, famine, war _ I don't think we need this one
... and I think we can do something about this one.''
   Since Christmas week, his public service announcement has been
broadcast nationwide with help from the U.S. Department of
Transportation. The ad has been nominated for a top industry award.
   Gotfriend and his friend, Michael Flax, grew up together on
Chicago's South Side.
   Flax was killed two weeks after his 29th birthday in October
1985. He was crossing the street near Soldier Field after a Bears'
football game when ``suddenly this car came out of nowhere'' and
slammed into him, said Gotfried.
   Flax, who worked for a Chicago trade exchange, died instantly.
   ``He was a good guy, and it was a shame. It's true when they say
the good die young. He was a good one,'' Gotfried, 33, said in a
telephone interview.
   ``That's where the pain is,'' he said. ``He's dead. He's gone. He
doesn't feel anything. The pain is here. And it hurts.''
   Gotfried, who owns a Chicago film production company that makes
commercials, decided to channel his pain and anger into a project
with a special, personal meaning.
   ``I think it's real love,'' said Michael's father, Manny Flax of
suburban Northbrook.
   ``He loved my son so much that he had to do this.''
   Gotfried sent his proposal to an ad council that passed it on to
the Department of Transportation.
   Federal officials sent him a letter last summer saying, ``If you
can get the spot produced, we will assist you in national
distribution,'' Gotfried recalled.
   Insurance companies, soft-drink manufacturers and other groups
turned down his requests for financing, but friends donated about
$75,000 in time, talent and cash. Gotfried pitched in $6,000.
   The ad depicts a trucker whose buddy has just been killed by a
drunken driver. Lonely and depressed, he goes to a diner they used
to frequent. Their pictures hang on a wall.
   Gotfried posed for the photograph of the trucker's friend.
Singer-guitarist Dave Mason, a friend, provided the backround music.
   ``The tag line is, `Please don't drink, then drive,''' Gotfried
said.
   The spot was recently nominated for a Clio award, the advertising
industry's equivalent of an Oscar. Winners will be announced this
spring.

   Robert Teeter, a top political adviser to
President-elect Bush, has decided to turn down an offer to become
deputy White House chief of staff, a top transition official said
Monday.
   Craig Fuller, co-director along with Teeter of Bush's transition
office, said Teeter, who lives in Michigan, did not want to uproot
his family to move to Washington.
   However, Fuller told reporters that Teeter would continue to
serve as a part-time domestic policy adviser to the incoming Bush
administration. ``His advice has been sought for over a decade and
will continue to be sought,'' Fuller said.
   Teeter, who had served as pollster and chief political strategist
for the Bush campaign, had been offered the No. 2 White House staff
job by incoming chief of staff John Sununu.
   Fuller said Teeter made his decision known to both Bush and
Sununu Monday morning.

<HEAD>Reagan Budgets $88.5 Million for Ten Water Projects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration sought funds Monday
for 10 new flood control and navigation projects, including several
Congress refused to launch last year.
   It requested $88.5 million in its fiscal 1990 budget for the Army
Corps of Engineers projects. Six were in last year's Reagan budget,
but Congress refused to start any. The four new projects are in
Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
   The number of new projects has slumped in recent years under the
pressure of tight budgets and a 1986 law requiring local communities
to put up a share of the initial cost.
   The budget calls for a new system of paying for maintenance on
the Bureau of Reclamation projects, largely bypassing the
congressional appropriations process.
   For the third year in a row, the bureau, which operates in the 17
westernmost states of the lower 48, proposed no new construction.
Sixty percent of the bureau's construction spending would be devoted
to three projects _ the Central Arizona Project, the Central Utah
Project and the Central Valley Project in California.
   The budget calls for no substantial construction money for the
controversial Garrison Diversion Unit in North Dakota until 1994,
though $8.75 million would be earmarked to complete certain
facilities and secure those already built.
   Similarly, the Animas-La Plata Project in Colorado and New Mexico
was allocated only $3.7 million to bring to a ``reasonable
conclusion'' pre-construction activity and equipment purchases.
   The bureau would spend a total of $946 million, down 14 percent
from $1.103 billion this year. Its construction budget would be $655
million, down 7.2 percent from $706 million this year.
   The corps' spending would total $3.2 billion, down 1.7 percent
from $3.26 billion. Its construction spending would total $1.22
billion, up 8.9 percent from $1.12 billion.
   While the 10 new projects would require $85.5 million in start-up
funds, there was no estimate of how much the projects would
ultimately cost.
   Congress must appropriate funds for maintaining the bureau's
projects, including the gigantic dams it runs in the West whose
power is sold by the power marketing administrations of the Energy
Department.
   Some revenues from the bureau's dams and irrigation canals are
tagged as owed the Treasury for operation and maintenance, but
Congress must appropriate the money anyway. The bureau wants to use
those earmarked funds on its own.
   ``As a result of the increased managerial flexibility afforded by
the revolving fund, the bureau will be better able to coordinate its
plans for the operation and maintenance of existing dams, power
plants and irrigation facilities,'' the budget document said. The
Bonneville Power Administration and the Western Area Power
Administration ``will be full partners in approving budgets,
projects and priorities.''
   The budget called for spending $222 million on maintenance, up
from $177 million this year. But $107 million will come from the
revolving fund.
   ``There's quite a (maintenance) backlog we have to catch up on,''
Interior undersecretary Earl Geljde told reporters.
   Here are the 10 new Corps of Engineer projects. If two figures
are shown, the second figure represents the amount for construction
the administration requested last year. An ``F'' denotes the project
is for flood control; an ``N'' means a navigation project.
   The dollar figures are in budget authority, which usually
approximates actual outlays during the year. Outlay figures were not
immediately available.
   _Cache Creek Settling Basin, California, $5.5 million, $3.25
million, F.
   _Santa Ana River Mainstem, California, $20 million, $15 million,
F.
   _Ramapo and Mahway rivers, Mahwah, N.J. and Suffern, N.Y.,
$330,000, $300,000, F.
   _Sheyenne River, Riverside to Horace, N.D., $5.5 million, $2.7
million, F.
   _Nonconnah Creek, Tennessee and Mississippi, $1.5 million, $1.5
million, F.
   _Lock Haven, Pa., $7.6 million, $1.0 million, F.
   _Nelsonville, Ohio, levees on the Hocking River, $2.415 million,
F.
   _Point Marion Lock and Dam No. 8, Monongahela River, Pennsylvania
and West Virginia, $17.9 million, N.
   _Sims Bayou, Houston, Texas, $4.0 million, F.
   _Winfield Lock and Dam, West Virginia, $20.8 million, N.
   The Point Marion and Winfield projects listed construction funds
in last year's budget requests but were not shown as proposed new
starts because the corps said the money was for pre-construction
activities.
   The Sheyenne project is expanded from the one proposed last year,
extending to Horace instead of stopping at West Fargo.

   More than 5,000 people have signed a
homemade card to thank the U.S. Customs Service for seizing hundreds
of pounds of cocaine at the county airport.
   Rosanne Kinley, owner of a beauty salon in Anderson, collected
the signatures, and the card will be presented to agents Tuesday at
the Anderson County Sheriff's Department.
   ``I've been with customs almost 24 years, but I don't remember
ever having a group of citizens make a presentation like this one,''
said Bill Mason of the agency's Charleston office.
   Community involvement is something law enforcement agencies
strive for, said Mason, who is in charge for the agency in the
Carolinas and Georgia.
   ``We just want to thank them for their efforts and send a message
to drug pushers in Anderson that we don't want them in our town,''
Ms. Kinley said.
   Customs agents seized 708 pounds of cocaine Oct. 5. Agents had
tracked an airplane believed to be carrying the drugs from Colombia
to St. Augustine, Fla., where the plane made a stop, and then on to
Anderson.
   Three men were arrested when the plane landed. A fourth man,
owner of the plane, was found dead the next day in an apparent
suicide. A fifth man was arrested later.
   Three of them have pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and are
awaiting sentencing in U.S. District Court. The fourth suspect is
awaiting trial.

protest the building of a landing strip at a French research station
in the Antarctic.
   The environmentalists charged that the project, at the Dumont d'
Urville station, is damaging the ecology of the region and threatens
the habitat of thousands of sea birds and penguins.
   Other Greenpeace activists have staged protests at the site and
have attempted to block construction efforts.
   A Greenpeace statement released in West Germany said protesters
had been roughed up by French officials at the site.
   The group is demanding an immediate construction halt.

   Presidential son Michael Reagan has signed a
two-year contract to do news, weather and sports as co-host of a
morning radio talk show in San Diego.
   ``I'm excited about it. You can be the ugliest person ever and do
well on radio,'' Reagan, 43, said Monday from his suburban Sherman
Oaks home.
   Reagan, adopted son of Ronald Reagan and ex-wife Jane Wyman,
makes his KSDO radio debut Monday with co-host Jack Merker. They
will be on the air weekdays 5:30 a.m. to 9 a.m.
   He wouldn't divulge financial terms of his contract with the ABC

   ``It's not the money. The biggest thing is keeping yourself out

   Asked if he planned to have the president on his show, Reagan
said: ``I imagine he will be in the news so I will be talking about
him.''
   Michael Reagan and his family will still live in Sherman Oaks, 15
miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, he said. The radio host
will drive the 120 miles to work and stay in the San Diego home of
friends during the week.

<HEAD>Astronomers Say Star-Eating Pulsar Is Missing Link in Milky Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The recent discovery of a black widow binary _ a
star that destroys its orbiting companion like the spider that eats
its mate _ may provide a missing link in the evolution of the
heavens, astronomers said Monday.
   The object is a rapidly spinning binary pulsar, a dead, collapsed
star that is orbited by a larger, ordinary star.
   Astronomers have discovered that the pulsar is blasting away its
companion in the last phase of an intricate give and take between
the two distant orbs.
   ``The companion is being destroyed,'' said Frederic A. Rasio of
Cornell University. ``It is constantly losing matter. Eventually it
could completely disappear.''
   Astronomers say it appears that the pulsar uses its companion to
build up tremendous spinning speed, then turns on its mate, burning
it up.
   The pulsar is one of a small group of such objects that spin
extremely rapidly. The newly discovered pair is important because it
seems to help explain how they get to spin so fast.
   ``It offers a missing link between two classes of objects,'' said
Steve Maran of the Goddard Space Flight Center. ``That's why
astronomers are so excited.''
   The pulsar and its mate were discovered last spring by Andrew
Fruchter of the Carnegie Institution in Washington. Its implications
were described Monday at a meeting here of the American Astronomical
Society.
   A pulsar is an extremely dense, collapsed star made up of
neutrons. It is the remains of a large star that was destroyed in a
spectacular explosion called a supernova.
   Pulsars give off no light, but they broadcast twin rotating beams
of radar, like lighthouses in the sky.
   A pulsar is minute compared to the sun, but its mass is 50
percent greater. One teaspoon of pulsar matter weighs billions of
tons.
   Most pulsars spin about once a second and are slowing down.
However, the newly discovered one, known as PSR 1957-20, is one of
six discovered so far in the Milky Way that spin much faster, in
this case about 600 times a second.
   Astronomers theorize that these pulsars speed up by stealing a
stream of matter from a companion star. The companion ``spins up the
pulsar like a top,'' said Fruchter.
   However, while some of these fast-spinning pulsars have
companions, others do not.
   ``People wondered, if you spin up the pulsar with a companion,
where is the companion?'' said Fruchter. ``This may explain that.
The pulsar has evaporated the companion.''
   In the newly spotted couple, the companion is very near the
pulsar, just the distance of two and a half times the diameter of
the sun. Yet it is being bombarded with a blaze of atomic particles
5,000 times more intense than the sun.
   ``This is the only one (mate-eating one) that we have seen in the
galaxy. But there is the exciting possibility that there will be
many more,'' said E. Sterl Phinney of California Institute of
Technology.
   Astronomers were able to study the pair because the companion
regularly eclipses the pulsar. The companion revolves around the
pulsar once every nine hours, and each time it blocks out the
pulsar's radar beam for about 50 minutes.

<HEAD>Union Leader's Wife Gives First Post-Martial Law Interview</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of Lech Walesa has followed him
onto the pages of the Polish press for the first time since the 1981
martial-law crackdown, saying she is neither afraid nor hopeful
about the future.
   Danuta Walesa, a mother of eight who generally maintains her
privacy despite the worldwide attention focused on her husband, gave
an interview to the year's first edition of the Warsaw church weekly
Catholic Review.
   The story under the headline ``A Normal Life' follows several
interviews of Walesa that started appearing in official newspapers
after labor strikes ended in September.
   They represent the first official airing of the Solidarity
leader's views in seven years. But proposed government talks with
the opposition have stalled and Poland's economy continues to
deteriorate.
   ``Realistically speaking, because dreaming is no good, I don't
see a way out of this situation,'' said Mrs. Walesa, 39. ``I am
looking at what is going on now, what is being said and done _ this
is nothing. It is terrible.''
   Mrs. Walesa said she sees the government involved in a
``psychological struggle to mentally destroy people.''
   But she said, ``People don't let themselves be tread on. Not in
these times.''
   Mrs. Walesa went to Oslo in 1983 to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
for her husband, who feared he would not be allowed to return to
Poland if he left.
   She called the trip ``a beautiful challenge'' and described other
``nice experiences, even lofty'' as the wife of the leader of the
Polish opposition.
   But she recalled with bitterness the imposition of martial law in
December 1981, when Walesa began 11 months of internment and his
union was outlawed.
   ``My martial law started in March (1982),'' said Mrs. Walesa,
when her daughter, Maria, was to have been baptized. She said she
sought permission for her husband to attend but an official told her
the day before that her petition had been rejected.
   ``I got so mad then, I started screaming at him ... At (Soviet
leader Leonid) Brezhnev, at everybody who came into my mind,'' she
said.
   Mrs. Walesa, whose children range in age from 3 to 18, said it is
difficult to raise youngsters now, when the family and the school
represent two different worlds. ``At home one thing is said, at
school another,'' she said.
   She said her Roman Catholic faith gives her strength and she does
not fear a repeat of martial law, which was lifted in 1983.
   ``Maybe what I am saying will sound funny or even strange, but I
am not afraid of anything,'' she said.
   Accompanying the article was a photograph of the 10-member Walesa
family, the first to appear in the government-sanctioned press.
   Walesa said from the family's Gdansk home that he was pleased
with the article but agreed jokingly that he was fearful of
competition from his wife.
   He said she gave the interview because ``she expected people
would like to read it and whatever she has to say, people would like
to hear.''

   You get snagged figuring out your income taxes,
so you call the government's handy 800-number.
   That would cost you 50 cents or a dollar under the budget
proposals Ronald Reagan submitted to Congress Monday for the last
time in his presidency.
   On page 4-15, it pops up: ``a user fee on taypayer telephone
information services is proposed for 1991'' with design work and
trial runs to be done in the interlude.
   In scores of small ways, people would get less from the
government or pay more for what they get under the proposals the
president submitted.
   Fend for yourself is the general theme of Reagan's final budget,
one sure to be modified by George Bush when he takes office Jan. 20
and to be looked upon skeptically by the Democratic-controlled
Congress.
   Congress, in fact, already has seen _ and rejected _ many of
Reagan's economizing proposals. He offered them up again Monday,
anyway.
   Costs would go up or benefits down for boat owners, veterans with
slightly disabling war injuries, commuters, air travelers, federal
retirees, doctors, people who lose their jobs to foreign competition
and middle-class kids who eat subsidized lunches at school.
   Reagan noted that even students at ``high tuition private schools
can get meal subsidies'' and proposed to eliminate all 40-cent
lunches for kids from families well above the poverty line. The
costs would go up by about 26 cents unless the states or local
school districts made up the difference.
   For the homeless, the news could be better: Reagan proposed a
program under which the government would buy enough food to provide
food kitchens and food banks with 256 million meals.
   And for federal prisoners, Reagan called for ``an aggressive
prison building program'' to cut overcrowding, now put at 60 percent.
   But military veterans with service-connected injuries that give
them disability ratings of 20 percent or less would have to look to
private health insurance for their care in veterans' hospitals. The
government now pays.
   The 34 million Americans who ride Amtrak would have to turn
elsewhere for transportation.
   Reagan proposed _ not for the first time _ to blow the whistle on
the railroad and find a customer for its Northeast Corridor service.
It would be cheaper to hand an air or bus ticket to every Amtrak
passenger, he said, than to pay a subsidy averaging $30 per
passenger.
   Reagan called, too, for eliminating subsidies that help run
subways and bus services and terminating a program that keeps air
service for many small communities.
   Doctors would have to accept smaller fees for treating the
elderly under Medicare and the poor under Medicaid. Radiologists,
anesthesiologists and surgeons especially would get less.
   The nation's six million boat owners _ weekend sailors and
commercial fishermen alike _ would have to buy a $25 Coast Guard
decal to help defray the costs of rescues in emergencies.
   Homebuyers would see a nearly four-fold increase in the 1 percent
fee for VA loan guarantees. It would rise to 3.8 percent under
Reagan's proposals.
   He proposed eliminating the 1990 cost-of-living increase in
pensions received by federal retirees and reworking the formula
under which COLA increases are granted so that the retired workers
would have to absorb the first 1 percent increase in the annual cost
of living.
   Workers who lose their jobs to foreign competition now get weekly
benefits while they look for other work. Reagan proposed eliminating
a program which he said works ``to benefit one group of
underemployed workers or uncompetitive firms.''

<HEAD>US Says Talks With Gadhafi Over Plant Not In Picture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's spokesman said Monday the
administration has no interest in negotiating with Libya's Moammar
Gadhafi over a plant the United States says will be used to produce
chemical weapons.
   Asked to comment on Gadhafi's offer to discuss the disputed
facility directly with U.S. government officials, presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We don't have a problem with
communications with Gadhafi.''
   Rather, Fitzwater told reporters, ``We have a problem with his
actions. ... So we feel there is no need for direct discussions.''
   The United States contends that a plant in the city of Rabta,
about 60 miles southwest of the Libyan capital of Tripoli, is a
factory for producing poison gas. Libyan officials say it is a
pharmaceutical plant.
   Gadhafi has offered the United States a one-time inspection of
the Rabta facility, but U.S. officials said such a visit would be
inadequate because the plant could quickly be modified to hide
evidence of chemical weapons production.
   Fitzwater said that U.S. interests in dealing with Libya are
represented by third-party intermediary governments, including
Belgium and the United Arab Emirates.
   ``We certainly know their position and they know ours,'' the
spokesman said. ``So there shouldn't be any need for direct
discussions. What there is a need for is for them to destroy that
plant.''
   Libya's foreign minister said Sunday that his country does not
intend to produce chemical weapons ``for the time being'' but is
seriously worried about possible U.S. military action against Libya.
   ``I don't think our know-how will enable us _ even if we decided
to do (so) _ to produce chemical weapons in the very near future,''
Foreign Minister Jadalla Azouz Ettalhi said.

   Libya said Monday the United States has launched a
``vile campaign'' against it with allegations over a chemical
weapons plant, and accused Washington of helping Israel stockpile
nuclear, chemical and biological arms.
   Foreign Minister Jadalah Azouz Ettalhi, speaking at an
international conference on chemical weapons, dismissed U.S. charges
that Libya has a chemical weapons plant as ``clearly false.''
   The Libyan minister mentioned the United States only once by name
_ to condemn the downing of two Libyan jet fighters last week _ and
referred to Israel as the ``racist Zionist entity.''
   He urged the international community to condemn the incident Jan.
4 over the Mediterranean as a military aggression. The United States
has said its action was in self-defense.
   Charges that Israel has nuclear weapons are at the heart of a
campaign by Arab states to link bans on nuclear and chemical arms.
The issue has stymied progress on a final communique to be issued
Wednesday at the close of the five-day conference.
   Ettalhi said the U.S. position on chemical weapons was
discriminatory.
   The United States and the Soviet Union admit to having large
stockpiles of chemical weapons _ the only two countries to make such
an admission of about 20 nations presumed to possess the weapons.
   There is a widespread fear that nations without a nuclear
capability will stock chemical arms.
   ``How can any member of the international community proclaim a
right it denies others,'' Ettalhi said, ``while at the same time
launching a vile campaign of calumny on the basis of a
discriminatory, racist position?''
   ``Agreed international rules must be applied to all parties
without discrimination,'' the Libyan minister said.
   Earlier Monday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze told
reporters that evidence presented to him by Secretary of State
George Shultz on the alleged chemical weapons plant at Rabta, south
of the Libyan capital of Tripoli, did not prove anything.
   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, also attending the
conference, charged Monday that Iraq, Syria and Libya _ three bitter
foes of Israel _ have chemical arms and represent ``a direct
threat.''
   U.S. arms control official Lynn Hansen, asked about Libya's
charge that Israel has nuclear weapons and that the United States
helped it obtain them, said: ``I'm not going to get down and grovel
with the Libyans about this or that.''
   Israel has never responded directly to allegations it has nuclear
weapons, saying only it will not be the first country to introduce
such weapons into the Middle East.
   Britain joined the United States on Monday in rejecting a link
between nuclear and chemical weapons bans.
   Ettalhi's speech was widely regarded as subdued in a conference
that has seen outbursts and public disputes since it began Saturday.
   Most delegates walked out of the conference hall before a speech
earlier Monday by South African Foreign Minister R.F. Botha.
   Hansen, head of the bureau of multilateral affairs at the U.S.
arms control agency, called the conference ``positive'' but admitted
difficulty in reaching a consensus on the final statement.
   The conference is aimed at reaffirming the only existing
international document on chemical weapons _ the 1925 Geneva
Protocol banning their use _ and pressing for a global,
comprehensive ban.
   Iraq's known use of chemical weapons in its eight-year war with
Iran has served as a macabre backdrop for delegates. A top U.S.
expert, speaking on condition of anonymity, said evidence shows that
Iraq was the chief producer of chemical arms among Arab nations,
followed by Syria. He said he had no information on Israel.
   A conference source said the final statement would necessarily
have to accommodate the demands of the Arab nations.
   The statement ``will have to take into account the preoccupations
of certain Arab countries,'' said the source, speaking on condition
of anonymity. ``But it is a bit too early to say what form that will
take.''
   A working version of the final statement obtained by The
Associated Press made no direct reference to linking nuclear and
chemical arms. But it referred to the need to obtain ``general and
complete disarmament.''
   It called on each state here to ``exercise restraint and act
responsibly'' on the issue of chemical arms until a convention
banning use, production and stocking of chemical weapons is reached.
   The final document will be of a political nature with no
enforcement power. But it is meant to pressure negotiators in Geneva
to overcome obstacles in talks that have languished for nearly a
decade.
   The Geneva convention would ban use, production and stockpiling
of chemical arms by all nations, but negotiators have failed to
reach agreement on such major issues as verification.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush bestowed cautious praise
on President Reagan's parting budget Monday, saying he ``agrees with
its intent'' while making clear he will develop his own proposals.
   ``I will continue to review it for possible amendments after I
assume the office of the presidency,'' Bush said in a succinct
written statement on the $1.15 trillion spending plan Reagan sent to
Congress for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   Bush also said he will have nothing further to say on his own
budget plans until after he takes office on Jan. 20.
   Craig Fuller, a senior Bush aide, read the vice president's
budget statement at a briefing but declined to elaborate upon it.
   He said the vice president ``has not made any final determination
about what shape (his) budget document, or framework, or
presentation'' will take. Fuller said Reagan's budget showed that
what Bush had talked about during his campaign, meeting
deficit-reduction targets without raising taxes or disturbing Social
Security ``is do-able.''
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady _ whom Bush has asked to stay
on _ told reporters that ``work is actively under way'' on Bush's
budget modifications.
   ``It is certainly possible that much of the current budget will
remain on the table, although it is too early at this stage to offer
more specific details,'' Brady said.
   Brady also said that Reagan's budget, by proposing the legally
required deficit reduction without seeking higher taxes, meets a
goal ``fully shared by President-elect Bush.''
   The vice president, in his statement, said that Reagan's farewell
budget ``is an excellent budget which demonstrates clearly that the
targets set under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law can be met and
indeed exceeded without raising taxes.
   ``Naturally, I support its intent,'' he added.
   The deficit law calls for a fiscal 1990 deficit of no more than
$100 billion. The new Reagan budget projects a deficit _ assuming
adoption of all its elements _ of $92.8 billion for 1990, down from
an estimated $161.5 billion deficit in the current fiscal year.
   During his campaign, Bush advocated what he called a ``flexible
freeze'' on federal spending. The concept calls for holding the
increase in overall spending at the annual rate of inflation _
currently running at about 4.4 percent.
   Any proposed additional increases would have to be offset by
corresponding decreases in other programs _ except that Social
Security benefits would not be touched.
   Bush will have to find room in the Reagan budget outline for the
increases in spending needed for the ``kinder, gentler nation''
programs he proposed in his campaign _ including expected increases
for education, child care, expansion of the government's Head Start
program and enviromental cleanup.
   And, even though Reagan's budget appears to smooth the way for
some of these modifications, in some cases the document appears at
odds with Bush's campaign statements.
   For instance, Bush has proposed an increase of Medicaid to help
cover medical expenses for poor pregnant women and their babies.
Reagan, in the new budget, has proposed over $1 billion in Medicaid
reductions.
   Reagan's budget again calls for austerity in social programs and
would eliminate 82 programs. At the same time, the plan would
protect his defense buildup by advocating a 2 percent increase in
defense spending authority above inflation.
   Congressional budget writers have said they expect defense
spending may be one of the areas Bush looks at most closely as he
seeks to find offsetting reductions to make his ``flexibile freeze''
work.
   Both he and incoming Defense Secretary John Tower have talked
publicly about the need for more defense economies, particularly in
the area of troop strength.
   Bush aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the
vice president did not want to upstage the president on Monday by
reacting at length to the budget document.
   ``Naturally, he agrees with its intent. And, naturally, he'll
have his own recommendations, or put forth potential amendments,
once he takes office,'' said one senior transition official.
   ``But he won't be presenting any of those recommendations until
he's prepared to present all of them to the Congress, whatever time
that might be,'' the official added.

<HEAD>Thousands Stage Warning Strike; Unions Criticize Price Increases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of workers in eastern
Hungary staged a 10-minute warning strike Monday against big price
increases, and trade unions charged the government is ``picking the
pockets'' of the people.
   The state news agency MTI reported workers in Szabolcs-Szatmar
county started work with a 10-minute delay and said local trade
union leaders supported their action.
   MTI estimated the increases that took effect Monday will cost
consumers $15 a month, and predicted food consumption will drop 10
percent to 15 percent in the first half of the year.
   ``Behind these stark sets of figures there are human lives,''
Nepszava, the official trade union daily, said in a Monday editorial.
   Trade union leaders already have warned the increases could spark
strikes.
   According to the Nepszava, 10 percent of families in Hungary live
on a smaller monthly income than the official subsistence level of
$72.
   Inflation amounted to 17 percent in 1988, when real wages dropped
by 8 percent, according to official statistics.
   ``The characteristic feature of the government's financial policy
will be picking the pockets of the companies and the population,''
Nepszava charged.
   Hungarian officials Monday told journalists the price rises were
needed to reduce state subsidies and balance the budget. They are
part of a series of economic reforms and austerity measures the
government is introducing to help reduce Hungary's $17 billion
foreign debt and stimulate the stagnating economy.
   Trade union leaders support the idea of allowing the market to
regulate prices, but admonished the government to apply these rules
also to wages.
   ``On what ground does the government believe that labor can be
bought for less than it costs?'' the paper asked. ``No order, no
stabilization can possibly emerge until honest work is paid by
honest wages.''
   Other increases planned this year include raising public
transportation costs by 62 percent Feb. 1 and household water and
sewage fees by 220 percent to 290 percent March 1.
   In Budapest and elsewhere, citizens anticipated the price hikes
by stockpiling, leaving food shop shelves completely bare last week.
   Prices of pork, poultry and meat preparations went up by 13
percent to 14 percent from Monday andd beef prices increased 30
percent. Now, consumers pay $1.65 for a pound of medium quality beef
and 12 cents for a pint of milk that cost 9 cents last week.

<HEAD>Ambassador Discloses `Debt-For-Bases' Proposal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Japanese banks may agree to
pay part of the Philippines' $28 billion foreign debt if Manila
allows U.S. bases to remain here, the Philippine ambassador to
Washington said Monday.
   Two visiting U.S. senators, meanwhile, pledged to persuade their
colleagues to support an agreement under which the United States
would pay $962 million over the last two years of the bases' lease.
The agreement, signed by Filipino and American negotiators in
October, needs congressional approval.
   Ambassador Emmanuel Pelaez told reporters that he had received
``feelers'' on the ``debt-for-bases'' deal from Japanese and
American financiers who are ``proposing it as a straight commercial
deal.''
   He did not give further details.
   Pelaez said the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
probably would support such a deal as a way to ensure political and
economic stability in the Philippines.
   The United States has six installations in the Philippines,
including Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay naval base. The lease on
the installations expires in 1991, and President Corazon Aquino has
refused to say whether she will support an extension.
   Pelaez said that closing the bases could ``lead to political
upheavals.''
   Also on Monday, Sens. Richard Lugar. R-Ind., and Thad Cochran,
R-Miss., said they were pleased with progess in the Philippines
since 1986, when they visited the country to observe an election
that both Mrs. Aquino and former President Ferdinand Marcos claimed
they won.
   Marcos was toppled two weeks after the election in a popular
uprising that swept Mrs. Aquino to power.
   Lugar, the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, said that he and Cochran will work for passage of the
$962 million base lease agreement.
   He also said they would try to build congressional support for
$200 million in economic aid for the Philippines.
   The senators ended their four-day visit Monday by departing for
Thailand on the second stop of an Asian tour that also will include
Singapore and South Korea.

<HEAD>District Attorney Says Prosecution Possible in 1964 Civil Rights
Slayings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The case that sparked the movie
``Mississippi Burning'' involving the 1964 slayings of three civil
rights workers could be reopened, but the district attorney does not
plan to give it special attention.
   ``There's no statute of limitations on murder, so it could be
prosecuted,'' said Neshoba County District Attorney Ken Turner.
   But Turner said he was not aware of any new evidence, and
indicated he had no special interest in prosecuting the case.
   ``I'm interested in prosecuting any murder case. I wouldn't
single this case out,'' Turner said. ``We can't prosecute on
emotion.''
   The slayings of Andrew Goodman, James Chaney and Michael
Schwerner on June 21, 1964, have received renewed attention as a
result of publicity surrounding the release of ``Mississippi
Burning,'' which uses the deaths near Philadelphia as the basis for
a fictitious story on the turbulent civil rights era.
   The three civil rights workers were killed by a Ku Klux Klan
group shortly after they arrived in Mississippi. The FBI found their
bodies buried in an earthen dam in the county 44 days after the
killings.
   Eight men were convicted on federal charges in 1967 of conspiring
to deprive the three of their civil rights. Mississippi never
brought murder charges in the case.
   ``I think it was a tragic time in Mississippi history,'' said
state Attorney General Mike Moore. ``What we should all remember is
that it's been 25 or so years. The Mississippi we have today is a
much different, brighter, much more intelligent place to live.''
   Moore said a decision to prosecute rested with Turner.
   Turner was in meetings Monday with a grand jury and had not
returned calls from The Associated Press seeking additional comment.
Neshoba County NAACP Chairman Pete Talley of Philadelphia was out of
town and not available for comment.
   W.H. Johnson of Decatur, who was district attorney from 1964-72,
said that at the time the ``state government didn't trust the
federal government, and the federal government didn't trust the
state government.'' He said he presented the slayings before a grand
jury three times without success.
   ``I felt it should be tried at the local level, but you had to
have indictments to do it,'' he said.
   Six weeks after the bodies were found, a Neshoba County grand
jury was impaneled and subpoenas were issued to FBI agents. However,
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover told a circuit judge his agents would
not disclose any information.
   FBI agents said they didn't turn over information because they
had to protect their sources from possible violence.
   In its report, the grand jury said its investigation had been
``curtailed, and in fact stymied, by the failure and refusal of
agents'' to testify.
   The county grand jury in September 1964 defended local law
enforcement officials, saying they had done ``an exceptional job of
maintaining law and order in this county, even in the face of
drastic provocation....''
   But retired agent Joseph Sullivan, who led the FBI investigation
   into the murders, had another view of the case.
   
   ``Neshoba was an incredibly closed and racist county,'' he said
recently. ``The county's law enforcement officers knew what was
happening, the blacks and Indians in the county were almost supine,
and practically none of the whites in Philadelphia would cooperate
with us in solving the case; we found that almost every adult white
male in the county had connections with the Ku Klux Klan.''
   When the state of Mississippi failed to indict anyone in the
case, the federal government stepped in and charged 18 men with
conspiring to violate the victims' civil rights. Eventually, eight
were convicted and given sentences ranging from three to 10 years.

<TEXT>
   A jury was selected Monday to hear the
long-delayed trial of three avowed revolutionaries accused of
plotting to overthrow the government.
   It took 68 days in court to select jurors in a case that has
already cost more than $3 million. Both sides predict the trial will
last a year, even with the number of defendants whittled from eight
to three. Opening arguments were set for Tuesday.
   The three face charges of seditious conspiracy, or plotting to
topple the government by force; racketeering conspiracy; and
racketeering enterprise. They each face up to 60 years in prison and
$60,000 in fines if convicted.
   Up to 350 witnesses could be called to testify. Observers must
pass through two metal detectors to reach the courtroom, which an
estimated 40 marshals take turns guarding.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Loucks will present the
government's case against the defendants, whom he calls
``terrorists.''
   Loucks has alleged in court documents that the defendants are
dangerous members of an underground group that conspired to rob
banks and carry out at least 19 bombings, including an explosion
that rocked the Suffolk County Courthouse in 1976 and severed a
man's leg. The bombings injured 21 others.
   The indictment also alleges that the defendants plotted the 1981
murder of a New Jersey state trooper and two attempted murders in
Massachusetts and Maine.
   Defendant Raymond Luc Levasseur, 42, of Maine, will represent
himself, and attorneys will represent Levasseur's wife, Patricia
Gros Levasseur, 40, and Richard Williams, 41, of Boston.
   The defendants have maintained that what the prosecution
describes as terrorism is actually resistance to imperialistic
policies of the U.S. government in Central America and other places.
   Their attorneys have argued against the dangers of the seditious
conspiracy statute that makes it a crime to carry out plots to put
down or destroy the government. They maintain that the statute is
vague and so broad that it could be used to prosecute such minor
acts of civil disobedience as protests outside military
installations.
   ``What's at stake here is not just the rights of the people on
trial, it's the rights of every American,'' William Newman, who
represents Mrs. Levasseur, said Monday.
   All but five of the 17 jurors were picked at one fell swoop
Monday from a prescreened group of 45. Jury selection began in
April. Attorneys depleted the jury pool before they could pick the
alternates to sit with the panel of 12 jurors.
   After the jurors were seated, U.S. District Judge William G.
Young explained the charges and asked them to suspend judgment until
the evidence had been presented.
   ``The government has to prove somebody actually did something to
make a conspiracy come about,'' he said. ``On no account can a
person be prosecuted for his political beliefs.''
   The three defendants are all that remain of the eight who were
arrested in Ohio, Virginia and Massachusetts, most of them in 1984,
in what the prosecution has called the largest manhunt since the
Lindbergh kidnapping.
   Charges were dropped in August against two of the defendants _
Thomas W. Manning, 42, of Maine, and Jaan Karl Laaman, 40, of East
Boston _ because they were already serving long sentences.
   Manning's wife, Carol, 33, pleaded guilty this month, and Young
decided last week to hold a separate trial for Laaman's wife,
Barbara J. Curzi-Laaman, 31.
   One other defendant, Christopher King, 38, has been tried
separately and found guilty on the single count of seditious
conspiracy. He was sentenced to seven years in prison.

   Rival Shiite Moslem militiamen hacked
each other to death in ``horrific'' fighting Monday in which
Syrian-backed guerrillas recaptured strategic villages from
fundamentalists, police said.
   At least 80 people have been killed and 200 wounded as the
embattled villages changed hands in house-to-house combat between
the mainstream Amal militia and fundamentalist Hezbollah since
daybreak Sunday, said police.
   It was the highest 36-hour toll since the power struggle began in
April to dominate Lebanon's 1 million Shiites, the largest sect in
this nation of 4 million. Nearly 500 people have been killed and
1,500 injured in the confrontation.
   A police spokesman in Sidon, south Lebanon's provincial capital,
said fighters are committing ``horrific atrocities.'
   ``They're knifing, hacking and gunning each other to death in
Kfar Filla and Jbaa,'' he said.
   ``Many victims have been hacked to death in Kfar Melki, Kfar
Hatta and Kfar Beit. Others had their throats cut and some were
headless. Many were riddled with bullets,'' said the spokesman, who
cannot be identified under standing regulations.
   Amal and Hezbollah accused each other of ``atrocities and summary
executions.''
   Amal, Arabic for ``Hope,'' launched a counterattack before dawn
Monday and retook three of five villages seized by Hezbollah in a
lightning onslaught Sunday in south Lebanon's Iklim el-Tiffah, or
Apple Province.
   Reporters who drove into the battle area, near Israel's
self-designated ``security zone,'' said fierce fighting is raging
for the two other villages.
   The chain of hamlets lies along the main road from Sidon port, 25
miles south of Beirut, to the Israeli-held border enclave.
   Reporters said Amal drove Hezbollah out of the battered villages
of Kfar Hatta, Kfar Melki and Kfar Beit in hand-to-hand fighting.
   An Amal commander in Kfar Melki said about 1,000 of his men used
Syrian-supplied T-54 tanks to attack Kfar Filla and Jbaa, where 500
Hezbollah members are holed up.
   ``The battle for liberation will continue until the Hezbollah
cancer is uprooted from the whole of south Lebanon,'' said commander
Mohammed Ghossein.
   Amal said in a late night communique in Beirut that its fighters
recaptured Kfar Filla and were mopping up the last pockets of
resistance in Jbaa. The Sidon police spokesman said he could not
confirm this.
   The roar of multibarreled rocket launchers and tank fire boomed
across hills and valleys from Kfar Filla and Jbaa as reporters
watched from a distance.
   Cars hit by rocket-propelled grenades smoldered in the streets of
Kfar Hatta and Kfar Melki, whose 8,000 inhabitants spent the night
hiding in apple orchards and olive groves.
   ``They've burned my house, but God has burned them in Amal's
wrath!'' screamed Aisha Barhoum, a 35-year-old Shiite woman who
found her one-story house in Kfar Melki gutted.
   ``We've been liberated from Hezbolshaitan,'' she said, making a
pun with the Arabic for ``Party of Satan'' on Hezbollah's name,
which means ``Party of God.''
   Kfar Beit was almost deserted. Only two dozen of its 1,000
residents were seen; the rest apparently had fled.
   Iran and Syria, Tehran's main Arab ally in Iran's war against
Iraq, have been trying to rein in their feuding Lebanese proxies
despite differing interests in Lebanon.
   Ali Mohammed Besharati, Iran's first deputy foreign minister,
left Tehran on Monday for Syria to mediate between leaders of the
warring factions, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   Hezbollah wants to establish an Islamic republic in Lebanon
fashioned after Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime.
The more secular Amal is aligned with neighboring Syria, a secular
state.
   Police said Amal and Hezbollah gunners were locked in artillery
duels around other south Lebanon villages.
   In Tyre, south of Sidon, police said Amal militiamen rounded up
150 Hezbollah partisans in overnight house raids in the city and
surrounding villages.
   Syrian troops patrolled Beirut in the residential districts of
Noweiri and Bourj Abu Haidar where Amal and Hezbollah clashed for
two hours Sunday.
   Hezbollah's Sunday offensive in the south marked a comeback by
the fundamentalists, who were driven out of the region by Amal in a
four-day battle in April.

   Paul Fleischman and Stephen Gammel won the 1989
Newbery and Caldecott medals for the best children's books of the
year, the American Library Association announced Monday.
   Fleischman, of Pacific Grove, Calif., received the Newbery Medal
for ``Joyful Noise: Poems for Two Voices,'' which celebrates the
insect world in imagery, rhyme and onomatopoeia.
   Gammel, of St. Paul, Minn., received the Caldecott Medal for his
illustrations of ``Song and Dance Man,'' a book written by Karen
Ackerman about a grandfather recreating his vaudevillian past for
his grandchildren.
   The awards were announced at a news conference at the American
Library Association's midwinter meeting. The winners were chosen by
two 15-member committees of its Association for Library Service to
Children division.
   The Caldecott and Newbery prizes often mark books for best-seller
status among both children's librarians and parents. The Newbery
Medal has been awarded annually since 1922 and the Caldecott Medal
since 1938.
   The committees also named six runner-up or ``honor'' books.
   The two Newbery Honor books are: ``In the Beginning: Creation
Stories from Around the World,'' by Virginia Hamilton, and
``Scorpion,'' by Walter Dean Myers.
   The four Caldecott Honor books are: ``The Boy of the Three Year
Nap,'' illustrated by Allen Say, written by Dianne Snyder; ``Free
Fall,'' illustrated by David Wiesner; ``Goldilocks and the Three
Bears,'' illustrated by James Marshall, and ``Mirandy and Brother
Wind,'' illustrated by Jerry Pinknew, written by Patricia C.
McKissack.

   Troops shot and wounded 26 Palestinians during
clashes Monday, Arab reports said, as a general strike ordered by
Islamic fundamentalists and PLO-backed leaders closed down the
occupied territories.
   The worst clash erupted in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in the
occupied Gaza Strip, where Israeli soldiers opened fire on
stone-throwing youths and wounded 11, Arab reporters said.
   Ten Palestinians were admitted to Nasser Hospital near the camp,
including a 5-year-old boy with a gunshot wound in the right leg,
doctors said. A 27-year-old Palestinian involved in the clash
underwent emergency surgery at Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City for
removal of a bullet in the chest, the hospital said.
   Four Palestinians also were shot in the Farah refugee camp near
Nablus, including two teen-agers in critical condition with bullet
wounds to their stomachs, Palestinian doctors said.
   Army spokesmen confirmed 16 wounded, included four in Farah, two
in Khan Yunis and one in the Gaza Strip town of Rafah. The
spokesman, who cannot be identified under military rules, said he
was checking further.
   A 35-year-old Palestinian woman suspected of collaborating with
Israeli authorities was stabbed repeatedly by four masked Arabs who
broke into her home, Arab reporters and doctors said.
   They said the woman, a teacher from the West Bank village of
Hable, survived the attack and was hospitalized.
   The army said it had no report of a stabbing in Hable.
   Also Monday, 63 people were arrested after a violent protest
outside the Megiddo prison in northern Israel where many
Palestinians are detained, Israel television said.
   The clash began when seven members of an Israeli group called
``Stop the Occupation'' demonstrated outside the prison to protest
conditions of imprisonment, the report said.
   Demonstrators refused orders by troops to leave, and were removed
by force. At this point, relatives of prisoners waiting outside the
Megiddo gates started throwing stones and bottles at security forces
who fired tear gas, the report said.
   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told the president of
the European Parliament, Lord Plumb, that the European Community was
siding too much with the Palestinians to play an active role in the
peace process, Israel media said.
   Shamir also gave Plumb a message for Jordan in which he urged
Israel's neighbor to become more involved in the process. Plumb is
on a two-day official visit to Israel.
   Israeli settlers blocked a main West Bank highway and stoned
Palestinian cars after a resident of the Arab village of Kafr Nakif
hurled a firebomb at an Israeli car the night before, Palestinian
news reports said.
   They said 15 Arab cars were damaged on the highway connecting
Nablus with Qalqilya. The army confirmed the firebombing, which
caused no injuries or damage, but said it had no information on the
settlers' roadblock.
   The daily Haaretz reported Monday that Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin had renewed secret contacts with Palestinians on convening
municipal elections in the occupied territories for the first time
since 1976.
   The meetings at Rabin's Tel Aviv office were held in secret to
protect Arab participants from attacks by Palestinian nationalists,
the newspaper said.
   In a leaflet issued Monday, the Palestine Liberation
Oranization-backed leadership of the uprising rejected Israeli moves
for elections and called for escalation of the 13-month-old
Palestinian revolt, in which at least 348 Palestinians and 15
Israelis have been killed.
   ``Our heroic people, we are convinced that your struggle will
defeat the terrorist (Prime Minister Yitzhak) Shamir, who is trying
to end the uprising by holding elections to try to find another
leadership than our representative, the PLO,'' said the leaflet.
   The leaflet also called for a general strike Monday to coincide
with a call issued earlier by the Islamic fundamentalist group,
Hamas.
   Hamas supporters warned merchants against disobeying the strike
call. Red-painted graffiti in Nablus said: ``Any merchant who opens
his shop will find it torched to the ground.''

<HEAD>Reagan Again Wants Sharp Farm Cuts in Budget Critics Call Irrelevant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan proposed on Monday to cut
spending by the Agriculture Department in fiscal 1990 by 19 percent,
including sharp reductions for commodity programs, rural housing and
emergency disaster aid to farmers.
   Another proposal would eliminate federal school lunch subsidies
for children of middle and upper income families, requiring them to
pay 26 cents more per meal. The savings would amount to more than $3
million a day.
   Under the proposed budget to operate USDA in the year that will
begin Oct. 1, total spending would be held to $42.4 billion, down
from the estimated outlays of $52.1 billion in the current fiscal
year.
   ``As has been anticipated, this budget is largely irrelevant,''
said Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee. ``It might, of course, have been designed to make a Bush
budget appear kinder and gentler.''
   Spending on the department's Commodity Credit Corp. programs,
which includes wheat, corn and other major crop supports, would
decline to a six-year low of less than $11.6 billion billion from
more than $13.8 billion in 1989. The peak was $25.8 billion in 1986.
   The budget for CCC spending included $1.1 billion of unspecified
cuts that would be decided by the incoming Bush administration and
Congress. Future spending reductions in CCC programs could be in the
range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion annually for 1991 through 1994.
   Leahy said the Reagan blueprint for cutting farm programs raises
a question of whether the administration ``actually means to disarm
unilaterally just two months before the next round of trade talks.''
   The administration has urged under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade that all subsidies and other practices that
interfere with free trade be eliminated, but the idea hasn't caught
on.
   ``Cutting farm programs before obtaining an agreement from our
trading partners to do the same seems likely to undermine our GATT
negotiating position,'' Leahy said in a statement.
   Deputy Secretary Peter Myers said no legislation to carry out the
CCC proposal would be sent to Congress at this time.
   ``We're not going to be that presumptive,'' Myers said. ``We're
going to say, `Congress, here's a way you can cut $1.1 billion. Do
you want to wrestle with it?' We think the Bush administration
should have the perogative to look at it. It's a recommendation.
It's an option.''
   The Reagan budget proposal for operating CCC's farm programs
would include a 5 percent reduction in target prices beginning with
the 1990 crops, and slightly larger cuts the following three years.
Target prices are used to compute federal payments to farmers when
market prices fall short.
   Robert A. Denman, director of international and public affairs
for the National Farmers Union, said most recent Reagan budget
proposals ``have been dead on arrival'' when sent to Congress,
anyway.
   The proposed 5 percent cut in crop target prices for 1990 on top
of reductions already specified by the 1985 farm law may be part of
the Reagan budget plan but Denman hoped that ``it wouldn't
necessarily be in a Bush budget.''
   ``This budget is not drastically different from previous Reagan
budgets,'' USDA budget director Stephen B. Dewhurst said. ``The
basic position taken on farm programs is that we're spending too
much money on them.''
   In many other respects, the 1990 budget proposals for USDA
represent a continuation of Reagan administration policies,
including some that had been rejected by Congress in the past.
   For example, the 1990 budget seeks to eliminate school lunch
subsidies for non-needy children. Needy children would continue
getting free or reduced-price meals.
   But a child from a family having an income of more than 185
percent of the official poverty line _ $21,553 a year for a family
of four _ would have to pay about 26 cents more per day at the
school cafeteria, unless the states or local districts made up the
difference.
   Overall food and consumer services, which take almost half of the
USDA's annual budget, would remain mostly intact, however. Total
spending would be almost $20.6 billion, down from $21.3 billion this
year. Food stamps, which serve more than 18 million people, are
expected to cost about $12.7 billion, compared with almost $12.9
billion currently.
   A report by department budget analysts showed that spending for
small community and rural development would be chopped by nearly
two-thirds _ from $9.4 billion this year to $3.4 billion in fiscal
1990. Existing housing loans and grants, at a spending level of
$3.36 billion this year, would be terminated in favor of a housing
voucher program.
   Farm loans of the Farmers Home Administration would be reduced to
$3.7 billion from $4.9 billion this year and ``will continue the
shift from direct loans to guaranteed loans'' established by the
1985 farm law, the report said. Guaranteed operating loans are
expected to increase to $2.8 billion from $2.6 billion this year.
   But FmHA disaster loans, reflecting hoped-for better weather
conditions, are expected to decline to around $50 million from $600
million this year.
   The budget report said FmHA will continue to help farm borrowers
reschedule overdue loans so they can stay in business. However, many
have gone under and the FmHA currently holds almost 5,000 farms in
its inventory with a market value of about $650 million.
   Some increases were called for in a number of USDA programs,
including research and education, soil and water conservation, and
food safety and inspection services.
   Also, the administration seeks $250 million in supplemental
financing this fiscal year to help the Forest Service pay for
firefighting. A new plan was outlined to partially pay for
firefighting in the future by using money collected from timber
sales and mining on federal lands.

   The Navy said Monday it has selected the
General Dynamics Corp. as the lead contractor on its next class of
nuclear-powered attack submarine, the SSN-21 Seawolf.
   General Dynamics' victory over arch-rival Newport News
Shipbuilding and Drydock Co. came despite the fact that Newport News
earlier had won the lead contract for designing the hull of the new
sub.
   General Dynamics has been designing the nuclear propulsion system
for the new boat.
   The Navy said Monday it was awarding General Dynamics' Electric
Boat Division in Groton, Conn., a $726 million
``fixed-price-incentive contract'' for the lead Seawolf sub.
   ``Work will be performed in Groton, Conn., 67 percent; Quonset
Point, R.I., 23 percent, and Charleston, S.C., 10 percent, and is
expected to be completed in May 1995,'' the service said.
   The Navy declined to say what type of bid Newport News had
submitted in its competition with General Dynamics.
   The two shipyards compete annually to build the Navy's current
class of attack submarine, the so-called ``688,'' or Los Angeles,
class. Newport News was the lead contractor on that class.
   The Navy expects to award its last two contracts for 688 subs in
fiscal 1990 and then shift production entirely to the Seawolf in
fiscal 1991 by awarding contracts for two subs.
   Now that General Dynamics has won the contract to build the lead
boat, Newport News will not be in a position to compete in the
program until those fiscal 1991 contracts are awarded.
   The Navy expects the new Seawolf to help rebuild the U.S. edge in
underwater warfare _ an advantage eroded over the past decade
because of espionage scandals and Soviet efforts to build quieter
submarines of their own.
   The SSN-21, like the 688-class sub, will be designed primarily to
hunt and kill Soviet submarines. It is supposed to feature greater
speed, better sensors and longer-range weapons than the 688 class.
   The Seawolf ``is going to represent a major advance in speed,
depth, quieting, weapons capability and supportability,'' the Navy
said Monday.

   Fireworks, a 50-gun salute and a flotilla of
ships will mark the 200th anniversary of the inauguration of George
Washington as the first president of the United States, Mayor Edward
I. Koch said Monday.
   The bicentennial celebration will include a re-enactment of
Washington's horse and carriage trip from Mount Vernon, Va., to
lower Manhattan, where he took the oath of office on April 30, 1789.
   ``This is the most appropriate place to celebrate this historic
anniversary, because New York City was the first capital of the
United States under the Constitution,'' Koch said.
   The federal government moved to Philadelphia in 1790 and to
Washington 10 years later.
   The mayor spoke at a news conference in Federal Hall, where
Washington was sworn in.
   Koch invited President-elect George Bush as well as the nation's
past living presidents to attend the inaugural observance on April
29 and 30.
   The events on April 29 will include daylight fireworks and a
parade of 13 Navy and Coast Guard ships representing the original
colonies, followed by nighttime fireworks over the East River.
   There will be an ecumenical service the next day in St. Paul's
Chapel on Lower Broadway, where Washington attended religious
services after his inauguration, followed by the commemorative
ceremony at Federal Hall at noon.
   There also will be a parade up Broadway that afternoon and an
inaugural gala dinner in the evening.
   Estimated cost of the observance, which is being privately
funded, is $1.5 million. So far, more than $1 million in
contributions and pledges has been received.

   Pakistan will try to mediate between
the Kremlin and Afghan guerrillas, who say they will not continue
talks while Moscow demands a role for Communists in Afghanistan's
future, an official said Monday.
   ``We will try to restart the process,'' a senior Foreign Ministry
official said on condition of anonymity.
   About 3.5 million Afghan refugees live in Pakistan after a decade
of civil war, and Moslem guerrillas use border camps and towns as
bases and supply points. The Soviets have been withdrawing their
soldiers from Afghanistan, and the last 50,000 are to be out by Feb.
15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement.
   Insurgent leaders met twice in Islamabad last Friday with Yuli
Vorontsov, Soviet deputy foreign minister and ambassador to
Afghanistan. But they told a news conference Monday there will be no
more talks until the Kremlin gives up its insistence that the
Communist Party be included in the next government.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, chairman of the seven-party guerrilla
alliance, said further talks were ``futile and give propaganda
material'' to the Soviets.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a Communist coup in April
1978. Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979,
growing to an estimated 115,000 soldiers before the withdrawal began
May 15, 1988.
   Most arms and support for the guerrillas come from the United
States and Pakistan.
   The Pakistani official said the guerrilla alliance had fought the
Communists in Afghanistan ``for all these years and now is not
prepared to give them recognition. We will have to review the whole
thing with the alliance.''
   Vorontosov ended a four-day visit to Pakistan on Saturday, during
which he also met three times with Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub
Khan.
   ``We have impressed upon Vorontsov the importance of recognizing
the realities of the situation and negotiate with'' the guerrillas,
Yaqub Khan said.
   In early December, the Soviet envoy began a diplomatic mission
seeking consensus on a broad-based government for Afghanistan after
the Soviet withdrawal.
   After meetings in Saudi Arabia and Islamabad, the guerrillas
initially agreed to another round. They reversed the decision Monday
after Vorontsov said Moscow would find a way to support its client
regime unless a government including the Communists was in place by
Feb. 15.
   Vorontsov also has met with Afghan guerrillas based in Iran,
Afghanistan's neighbor on the west, and former King Zahir Shah, who
was deposed in 1973 and lives in Rome. About 2 million Afghan
refugees are in Iran.
   Guerrillas based in Pakistan say they will establish a council of
more than 400 members to choose a transitional government to replace
the Communist government in Kabul, which they say is sure to fall
when the Soviets are gone.
   The Pakistani official said refugees will not be forced to return
to Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal is completed, but ``we
hope there will be conditions for them to go home in peace.''

   A 32-year-old businessman was killed Monday when
he slipped and fell to the tracks while trying to board a subway by
climbing between two cars, authorities said.
   About 1,200 passengers had to be evacuated along a narrow catwalk
and through an empty train, and 30,000 commuters were inconvenienced
as service on part of that line was suspended for more than 2{
hours, Transit Authority spokesman Bob Previdi said.
   A 1984 driver's license identified the victi as John Gilmore, 32,
but the address listed did not check out, said Al O'Leary, a Transit
Police spokesman. Police have been unable to locate any relatives
and Gilmore carried no current employer identification, O'Leary
said. The dead man was wearing a suit and tie, his briefcase was
found and he was carrying $194 in cash.
   He apparently was dragged several hundred yards before his body
triggered a brake switch on the underside of each car. When the
train stopped, the motorman got out to investigate and found the
body.
   While rescuers used air bags to lift the subway car and retrieve
the body, about 1,200 passengers had to be evacuated.
   Passengers in a train behind the stopped train were discharged at
the nearest station and the empty train proceeded until it reached
the stopped train.
   Passengers in the stopped train were guided back to the eighth
car, then were led out an open door onto the narrow catwalk in the
tunnel. They were led along the catwalk past the car where the
rescue was under way, then back onto the last car. From there, they
were able to step into the second train, walk the length of that
train, then get back onto the catwalk for the last 50 feet to a
station platform, Previdi said.
   A similar fatality occurred Friday. There were no witnesses in
that instance, but transit officials believe Harry Foy, 27, of
Queens, fell between cars.

<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan, the most conservative president
since Herbert Hoover, is leaving office after eight years with the
hallmark programs of the New Deal and Great Society not only
unscathed but thriving.
   He is also leaving a national debt that has almost tripled during
his time and office. This mountain of debt will prove to be a severe
constraint on George Bush's room to maneuver.
   Persons listening to Reagan's first inaugural address can be
excused for being perplexed by these developments.
   On that January day in 1981, Reagan denounced budget deficits and
vowed to end them. He said government was not the solution to our
problems but the problem itself.
   ``You and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing live beyond our
means, but for only a limited period of time. Why, then, should we
think that collectively, as a nation, we're not bound by the same
limitation,'' Reagan asked his listeners. ``We must act today in
order to preserve tomorrow. And let there be no misunderstanding: We
are going to begin to act, beginning today.''
   Now, eight years later, he is leaving office after running up the
largest budget deficits in history and with a balanced budget still
a distant goal on the horizon. The final budget projects a 1990
deficit of $92.5 billion and a balanced budget by 1993.
   Counting Monday's document, Reagan sent nine budgets to Congress,
none of them with balanced spending and revenues. Each spending plan
projected that the budget would one day be balanced, but only in the
distant fugure, not in the budget year under consideration.
   For example, Reagan's first budget, sent up in February 1981,
forecast a balanced budget by 1984, the last year of his first term.
Instead, the government suffered a deficit of $185.3 billion in
1984, an imbalance that was surpassed in both 1985 and 1986, a year
when the deficit hit a record $221 billion.
   In his final budget message to Congress, Reagan placed the blame
for the tide of red ink on the steep 1981-82 recession, which
lowered government revenues, and on Congress, which refused to go
along with his proposed spending cuts.
   But in the area of spending, Reagan himself decided that it would
be politically unwise to launch an assault against the major
middle-class government benefit programs.
   He put Social Security, the most enduring legacy of Franklin
Roosevelt's New Deal and the government's biggest benefit program,
off limits to budget cuts.
   As a result, Reagan's final budget projected Social Security
payments to nearly 40 million Social Security beneficiaries would
total $241 billion in 1990, one-fifth of the total $1.15 trillion
budget and a 6 percent increase over the current year, a bigger
increase than Reagan awarded the Pentagon.
   Even after removing the effects of inflation, Social Security
spending has grown by 27 percent from 1980 to 1988.
   Medicare and Medicaid, the two biggest programs from Lyndon
Johnson's Great Society, are also doing well.
   Medicare, which provides health coverage for Social Security
recipients, has nearly doubled during the Reagan years, as the cost
of health care and the elderly population have both grown at rapid
clips.
   Medicaid, which provides health care for the poor, has shot up 50
percent between 1980 and 1988.
   Reagan, struggling to contain health costs, did propose trimming
the projected growth in both programs in 1990, but even with the
cuts the government's health bill will still represent its
fastest-growing sector.
   While Reagan did trim some poverty programs, including subsidized
housing and low-income energy assistance, the budget document shows
overall spending in these areas remained relatively stable,
representing 1.7 percent of the country's total economy in 1980 and
1.6 percent in 1988.
   One area that showed a huge increase, however, was the money
spent to finance the national debt. The administration said the
government will spend $170.1 billion on interest payments in 1990.
   That means that 15 cents out of every dollar of government
spending will go to pay the interest on the $2.6 trillion national
debt, a debt burden which has almost tripled during the Reagan years.
   Interest payments surged from 2 percent of the total economy in
1980 to 3.2 percent in 1988. This development has crowded out
spending for other programs and will constrain Bush as he struggles
to find the money to fulfill his campaign promises to boost spending
for education, child care, housing for the homeless and cleaning up
the environment.
   The $170.1 billion interest payment projected in the budget for
1990 is more than the combined budgets of the departments of
Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Energy, Interior, Justice, Labor,
State and Transportation.
   ``This last (Reagan) budget is a sad testament to eight years of
borrowing from our children,'' said Jeff Faux, president of the
Economic Policy Institute, a labor-backed think-tank.
   But Richard Rahn, a leading supply-sider and chief economist for
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said that history will judge the
Reagan years more kindly.
   ``I would have liked to see more reductions in the growth of
spending and more progress against the deficit, but as the president
leaves office, it is clear that he had enormous success,'' Rahn
said. ``By the late 1970s, people felt that the government had
gotten out of control and that taxes, spending and regulation were
growing far too rapidly.''

<HEAD>Scientists Say Women Who Drink Caffeine May Have Trouble Conceiving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who drink caffeinated
beverages may take longer to become pregnant, say scientists at the
National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.
   ``Every epidemiologic study has limitations,'' said Dr. Allen J.
Wilcox, principal investigator. ``The findings were strong among
women in our study, but we won't be convinced until other
epidemiologists find the same results in other groups.''
   The study was published in December in The Lancet, a British
medical journal.
   The study of caffeine's effects on pregnancy was made as part of
a study of early pregnancy in which women planning to become
pregnant were enrolled at the time they stopped using birth control.
   A group of 104 women provided data on the amount of caffeinated
beverages they consumed during the time they tried to conceive, the
study said. Women who drank more than one cup of caffeinated coffee
a day, or the equivalent in tea and colas, took significantly longer
to become pregnant than women who drank less.
   The husbands' caffeine consumption has no apparent effect, the
study said. Factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, frequency
of intercourse and women's age did not change the findings.
   ``Even if the effect is real, there is no evidence that caffeine
does permanent harm,'' Wilcox said. ``Our data suggests that it is
the women's current caffeine consumption, not her past habits, that
affects her fertility.
   ``Fortunately, women can avoid caffeinated beverages if
necessary. Also, there were women in our study who became pregnant
quickly even while drinking large amounts of coffee. Obviously, if
caffeine is an influence on fertility, it is not the only influence.
Some women may be more susceptible to caffeine effects than others.''

<TEXT>
   Atlanta City Councilman Hosea Williams,
arrested in March for trying to carry a gun past airport security,
was fined $1,000 Monday after pleading no contest to two misdemeanor
weapons charges.
   Williams already has paid a separate $1,000 civil fine to the
Federal Aviation Administration over the incident, which occurred as
he was going to board a plane at Hartsfield Atlanta International
Airport. Security officers found a .38-caliber pistol in his
briefcase.
   In proceedings Monday before Superior Court Judge William H.
Ison, Williams also received a 12-month suspended sentence on the
two charges: carrying a concealed weapon and carrying a pistol
without a permit.
   For a time, Williams, who has been arrested many times for poor
driving and for his demonstrations for civil rights, was charged
with a felony count of weapons possession by a convicted felon. But
Ison threw out that charge _ which could have cost Williams his
council seat.
   Williams said his sentence spoke ``to the integrity of the
judicial system in Clayton County,'' and said he no longer carries
guns outside his home.
   At the time of his arrest, Williams said he had forgotten the gun
was in his briefcase.

<HEAD>Britons Protest Philip's Attendance At Hirohito Funeral</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Japan, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The announcement Monday that Prince Philip will
represent his wife, Queen Elizabeth II, at the funeral of Emperor
Hirohito of Japan brought angry protests from lawmakers and World
War II veterans.
   Buckingham Palace announced that Philip, who served in the Far
East during the war and was present at the Japanese surrender in
Tokyo Bay, would attend the Feb. 24 services in Tokyo for Hirohito,
who died Jan. 7 at the age of 87 after 62 years on the throne.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe will represent Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's government.
   Conservative lawmaker Terry Dicks urged the prince to resign as
president of the Burma Star Association, the organization of Far
East war veterans, some of whom urged the royal family to boycott
the services. Dicks said whoever made the decision to send him
``should be shot.''
   The queen, who does not attend the funerals of heads of state,
acts on the advice of government ministers on such issues as sending
representatives.
   Harold Payne, president of the National Federation of Far Eastern
Prisoners-of-War Associations, said he was ``deeply saddened'' by
the decision.
   Opposition Labor Party lawmaker Ron Brown, who described Hirohito
as ``a war criminal of the worst kind,'' called for a nationwide
campaign to change the decision.
   ``It is a grave insult to many people who were enslaved, tortured
and killed by the Japanese during the last war,'' he said.
   But David Owen, leader of the moderate Social Democratic and
Labor Party, described the choice of the Duke of Edinburgh as
``imaginative, correct and courageous.''
   Conservative lawmaker Ivor Stanbrook also applauded the decision.
``The proper time to consider relations with the emperor of Japan
was when we invited him here in 1971 as an honored guest on a state
visit,'' he said.
   Critics say the presence of a member of the British royal family
would dignify a monarch who oversaw Japan's militaristic regime
during World War II and its harsh treatment of prisoners.
   About 27,000 British prisoners died at the hands of the Japanese
in the 1939-1945 war, and many survivors regard him as a war
criminal.
   Historians generally agree that Hirohito was a figurehead who
lacked power to do anything but approve decisions of military
leaders.
   Hirohito visted Britain in 1971, and the queen made an official
return visit in 1975.
   A 1986 visit to Japan by Prince Charles and his wife, Princess
Diana, played a significant role in smoothing postwar relations
between Britain and Japan.
   The queen, Charles and Diana have sent messages of condolence to
the new emperor, Akihito, and the dowager empress.

<HEAD>Anti-U.S. Rhetoric Cools In Libya Debate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The anti-American rhetoric ebbed Monday as
diplomats worked to fashion a Security Council resolution critical
of the U.S. downing of two Libyan MiGs but mild enough to survive
U.S. and British veto threats.
   Britain agrees with Washington's explanation that the Libyan
MiG-23s acted in a threatening manner on Wednesday in flying toward
two U.S. F-14s on patrol over international waters in the
Mediterranean.
   The U.N. Charter permits use of force in self-defense.
   Libya says the MiGs were on reconnaissance and unarmed. In
Security Council debate Friday, U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters
showed photographs of one MiG with what he said were missiles under
its wings. Libyam envoy Ali Sunni Muntasser said the pictures were
retouched.
   Diplomats said on condition of anonymity that they expect America
and Britain will jointly veto any resolution critical of the United
States. The council reconvenes Tuesday afternoon and a vote is
expected later in the day.
   The diplomats said the non-aligned nations were tinkering with
the language of a critical resolution, dropping ``condemn'' and
substituting ``strongly deplore,'' and referring to a U.S.
``attack'' and not an ``unprovoked attack.''
   Council speeches Monday were more temperate than Friday's heated
exchanges between Libya and the United States and some of the other
speeches.
   The speakers on Monday _ Finland, Ethiopia, Senegal, Sudan,
India, Morocco, Bangladesh and France _ contrasted the air fight
over the Mediterranean in the first week of the new year with the
atmosphere of detente and cooperation that prevailed in 1988.
   The aerial battle and the war of words between Libya and America
``were like thunder in a calm sky,'' said Senegal's Saidou Nourou Ba.
   ``We hope every one will exercise restraint and refrain from any
act which could enhance tensions,'' said French envoy Pierre
Brochand.
   A draft resolution circulated by the non-aligned nations asks the
U.S. Navy to withdraw from international waters in the Mediterranean.
   Libyan Ambassador Ali A. Treiki told reporters later the
non-aligned nations were still discussing changes in the draft.
   ``The tone was quite different today in the chamber,'' Walters
said afterward. ``Today there was considerably more temperate
language.''
   But he said the latest compromise resolution still was ``not
sufficiently good for me to change my position on it'' _ meaning
veto it.
   Each of the five permanent council members _ the United States,
the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France _ has veto power to kill
any resolution.
   British Ambassador Sir Crispin Tickell told reporters, ``The
United States acted within its rights ... (of) self-defense, so
although we, like everybody else, regret the incident, we're not in
the business of condemning or deploring actions by the United States
in this regard.''
   Commenting on the more moderate speeches Monday, Tickell said
that ``perhaps, even in some quarters, good sense gradually creeps
in like a tide.''
   China and the Soviet Union were expected to vote in favor of any
resolution. France was likely to abstain.
   The 10 non-permanent council members are Canada, Finland,
Ethiopia, Colombia, Malaysia, Algeria, Brazil, Nepal, Senegal and
Yugoslavia.
   Canada was considered likely to abstain; the rest favored a
critical resolution.

<TEXT>
   The horrible deaths by poison gas of nearly 1
million soldiers in the trenches of World War I so shocked the world
that in 1925 a group of nations agreed never to use such weapons
again.
   But this week's Paris conference reviewing the agreement takes
place with a clock grimly ticking. Each year, observers say, the
list of countries owning and developing chemical weapons grows. And
the use of such weapons lies in the not-so-distant past.
   Under strong international public pressure, the 1925 Geneva
Protocol was reached banning the use of chemical weapons, and 118
countries signed up. Sixty-four years later, delegates at the
conference are reviewing the violations of the ban over the years
and discussing ways to give it meaning and teeth.
   The 1925 protocol covers only use. Most delegates here agree the
world also needs to ban development, production and storage of toxic
agents. They also agree some organization, maybe the United Nations,
should be able to check that countries are abiding by the ban and
that those violating it should be punished.
   The need for an expanded international agreement on chemical and
biological arms has been recognized for a long time. Negotiators
have been meeting periodically to come up with an accord for 17
years.
   When the last meeting in Geneva of the ad hoc committee on
chemical weapons under the U.N. Conference on Disarmament closed
April 28 last year, nothing was ready to sign. Optimists said a
convention might be ready in another couple of years.
   President Reagan, speaking to the U.N. General Assembly last
fall, called for the international conference. President Francois
Mitterrand, speaking a few days later, agreed to host it.
   The 150 countries meeting in Paris hope they can find enough
common ground by Wednesday's close of their five-day meeting to
issue a final document sending a clear political message to the
negotiators: The world wants a new accord.
   The United States and the Soviet Union admit to having thousands
of tons in storage, but experts say at least 20 other countries
either have poison arms or will before long.
   Countries that have chemical weapons sell them to others that
don't, some experts at the meeting say. And possible customers
include terrorist groups.
   ``Who wants chemical weapons?'' asked a U.S. expert, speaking on
condition he not be named. ``I can't give you a list but I can give
you a set of criteria:
   ``Anybody who's got a neighbor who has them. Anybody who has a
resistence they want wiped out. Anybody with no chance of having
nuclear weapons. There are 40 or 50 countries that meet that
criteria,'' he said.
   Western officials say interest in developing toxic arms is keen
in the Middle East. They say Iraq has used chemical weapons over the
last five years and has more experience with toxic agents and
developing ``delivery systems,'' than either the Soviet Union or the
United States.
   Condemned by U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, the
Iraqi use of deadly poison is only the most recent example of
repeated violations.
   Others accused of breaking the agreement include Italy in
Ethiopia, Japan in China, Egypt in North Yemen, the United States in
Vietnam, the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, Libya in Chad and, if Nazi
gas chambers are included, Germany in the death camps of World War
II.
   Intelligence sources say other countries having chemical weapons
include Syria, Iran, Israel, Egypt, North Korea, South Korea and
Taiwan.

<TEXT>
   Marine Commandant Gen. Al Gray on Monday
accepted an investigative report which concludes there was a ``total
breakdown'' in accountability procedures within a unit that left a
young enlisted man to die in the California desert during a training
exercise.
   The Marine Corps, in a statement released at its Washington
headquarters, said Gray ordered a review of the conduct of some
additional officers in the affected unit after reviewing the report.
   One officer is already facing a preliminary investigation in the
matter and two sergeants are facing special courts-martial later
this month at Camp Lejeune, N.C.
   Those three have either been charged or are facing charges of
dereliction of duty in the death of Lance Cpl. Jason J. Rother, 19,
of Minneapolis, Minn. Rother's platoon leader and company commander
also have been relieved of their duties and reprimanded.
   ``Based upon additional recommendations made by the investigating
officer ... the commanding general of the 2nd Marine Division has
been directed to review the report and take appropriate action with
respect to the battalion commander and the battalion executive
officer of Rother's unit _ the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment of
the 2nd Marine Division,'' the headquarters statement said Monday.
   ``Gen. Gray stated that he would not accept `wasting lives in
so-called training accidents,''' the statement said.
   Quoting Gray, the statement continued: ``Rother's death was not
an accident. Accidents happen. His death didn't just happen; rather
it was the culminating event in a series of acts, each consciously
committed by human beings ... It was the certain and foreseeable
result of an attitude which I intend to see erased from our corps.''
   Rother was assigned to serve as a road guide during an exercise
at the Marine base at Twentynine Palms, Calif., last August, and was
not picked up after his unit moved through the area.
   Despite an extensive search, his remains were not discovered
until Dec. 4. Moreover, the Marine was not reported missing for
almost 40 hours after he should have been picked up.
   The investigation accepted by Gray ``concluded that poor planning
and direction in the placement and recovery of the Marines assigned
to the detail with Rother caused the failure to pick him up; and
that a total breakdown in the chain of personnel accountability
within Rother's unit led to the delay in accounting for his
whereabouts,'' the corps said Monday.
   The actions of some individuals in the unit reflect ``a state of
mind which contradicts every principle of concerned leadership on
which we (Marines) have traditionally prided ourselves,'' the
statement added.
   ``At the direction of the commandant of the Marine Corps, copies
of the completed investigation were provided to the parents of Lance
Cpl. Jason Rother.''

   State pro-choice advocates said they were
concerned about the U.S. Supreme Court's decision Monday to review a
Missouri law regulating abortions, but also said it might fire up
their movement.
   ``We are hopeful that the Supreme Court will realize the
importance of having the option of abortion,'' said B.J.
Isaacson-Jones, executive director of Reproductive Health Services,
an abortion clinic named in the state's appeal to the Supreme Court.
   She said she also saw the decision as ``an opportunity for
pro-choice people to keep the issue of choice in front of America.''
   Leaders from the movement to halt abortions were elated by the
justices' decision to study a lower-court ruling that struck down
key provisions of the Missouri law.
   Justice Department lawyers want the high court to use the
Missouri case as a means of undoing its landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade
ruling, which legalized abortion.
   There was nothing in Monday's brief order that indicated the
Supreme Court would reconsider its ruling of 16 years ago.
   ``We hoped all along that we could get the case up to the Supreme
Court and have the court look at some very important issues,'' said
Sam Lee, legislative director for Missouri Citizens For Life. ``And
we think with some changes in the court in the past couple years
there's a good chance that Roe vs. Wade may be partially or even
completely overturned.''
   Erika Fox, director of public affairs for Planned Parenthood of
Greater Kansas City, said the decision would provide a chance to
emphasize ``the dire consequences on the life and health of women
and their families if the clock is turned back to the time American
women were mutilated and even died as a result of botched
abortions.''
   Isaacsn-Jones added, ``People assumed that reproductive freedom
is protected by the Constitution. We know that may not be the case.
It is time for us to reorganize, regroup, be more vocal, be more
visible.''.
   In July, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is based in
St. Louis, struck down several provisions of Missouri's abortion
law, including:
   _a ban on using public hospitals or other government-run
facilities for abortions not necessary to save a woman's life;
   _a ban prohibiting any public employee from performing or
assisting an abortion;
   _and a ban on using taxpayer money for ``encouraging or
counseling'' women to have abortions.
   In the state's appeal, Attorney General William Webster said the
8th Circuit Court's ruling ``expands (Supreme Court) precedents in
favor of abortion on demand.''
   State Rep. Jim Barnes, a sponsor of the original law, said he was
pleased with the court's decision. But he said he did not believe it
would serve to overturn the decision in Roe vs. Wade.
   He predicted that if the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the
state, other states would use the law as a pattern for restricting
the use of public funds at facilities where abortions are performed
and for employees who offer abortion counseling.

<HEAD>14 Percent Increase Sought for War on Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan asked Congress on Monday to
increase spending on fighting drugs by 14 percent in a budget
proposal that the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration said
``clearly gives the message that drug law enforcement remains a
priority.''
   In his proposed budget for fiscal 1990, Reagan asked for $5.034
billion for the law enforcement, prevention and treatment agencies
engaged in the war on drugs. That reflects a $633 million increase
over the $4.401 billion to be spent this fiscal year.
   Asked if the increase is enough to tell the American people that
the administration is serious about a war on drugs, Deputy Attorney
General Harold G. Christensen told reporters, ``I think that this
program, given the constraints, does address that problem.''
   John C. Lawn, administrator of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, said that while the total increase for the Justice
Department in the proposed budget is 7 percent, ``the increase for
the Drug Enforcement Administration, in real money, is 13 percent.''
   ``I think this clearly gives the message that drug law
enforcement remains a priority of this government and this
administration,'' Lawn said.
   The DEA would add 275 foreign and domestic positions and would be
expected to increase arrests by more than 1,100 in the 1990 fiscal
year beginning next Oct. 1, according to budget documents.
   FBI Director William S. Sessions said his agency's strategy ``is
aligned purely to go after major drug trafficking and money
laundering organizations and heroin and cocaine.
   ``So with us, every incremental increase means that we can attack
that many more organizations,'' he said, referring to a proposed $12
million boost in FBI spending on drugs next year.
   When the FBI received $15 million more as a result of the 1986
drug bill, Sessions said the agency was able to mount attacks on an
addtional 5 percent to 10 percent of the approximately 450 major
drug trafficking organizations.
   Reagan requested a total of $3.49 billion in fiscal 1990 for law
enforcement in the drug wars, including $3.5 million in outlays for
the office of the new drug czar.
   Once appointed, whoever holds that position will also be in
control of up to $136 million in forfeitures of property seized in
drug-related cases.
   The budget requests also seeks $915.3 million in fiscal 1990
expenditures on drug abuse prevention and $633.2 million for
treatment programs, according to an administration official.
   Within the law enforcement category, drug interdiction efforts
would receive the largest allocation _ $1.22 billion.
   Spending on corrections facilities to house drug offenders would
total $722.3 million. Investigations would receive $716.4 million;
prosecutions, $306.7 million, and international programs, $238.3
million.
   Reagan is seekikng $415 million for the U.S. Customs Service to
``greatly expand the number of intensive examinations of high-risk
containerized cargo shipments,'' the budget documents said.
   The Coast Guard, meanwhile, would get an additional $47 million
to finance two surveillance aircraft and two land-based balloons for
spotting drug smugglers, according to the documents.
   The government said the addition of 940 positions proposed for
the U.S. attorney offices nationwide is expected to increase the
number of drug prosecutions in 1990 by 3,600 cases. In addition,
money has been requested to fund 6,685 new prison and jail bed
spaces as well as leasing authority for 1,160 more.
   Departments or agencies to receive significant amounts of money
for combatting drugs are:
   The Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration, $897.5
million; Coast Guard, $646.9 million; federal prisons, $614.4
million, with authorization for $664 million; the Drug Enforcement
Administration, $522 million, and the U.S. Customs Service, $415
million.
   Other agencies to receive substantial amounts for drug work are
the Education Department, $344.7 million; Defense Department, $323.8
million; U.S. Marshals Service, $148.4 million; State Department,
$112 million; U.S. attorneys, $112.2 million, and the FBI, $87.4
million.

   The Reagan administration unveiled a $13.2
billion foreign assistance budget for fiscal 1990 Monday, about a
third of which was to cover economic and military aid to Israel and
Egypt.
   Briefing reporters on the overall request, Deputy Secretary of
State John Whitehead said the budget would provide for the first
time since 1986 full funding of U.S. asssessed contributions to the
United Nations and other international organizations.
   Overall, the administration requested $14.8 billion in spending
authority but planned to spend $13.2 billion of that during the
coming year.
   The recommendations are subject to change because neither the
incoming Bush administration nor the Democratic-controlled Congress
is bound by them.
   The proposal was identical in most respects to the 1989 budget
although the administration decided to proposal the disbursal of all
military aid on a grant basis. Historically, a portion of military
assistance has been in the form of credits.
   Among the new items in the budget were $50 million in spending
authority for the U.N. forces that will oversee the transition this
year of Namibian independence from South African rule and $20
million for the U.N. peacekeeping for in the Persian Gulf.
   Also included in the request was $46 million in partial payment
of prior year arrearages to the United Nations. Whitehead said this
would be the first of several payments aimed at making up for $572
million in cumulative arrears to international organizations.
   Consistent with past practice, there was no request for
assistance for the Nicaraguan Contras in the budget message. The
Reagan administration routinely has treated that issue separately
and made no recommendations for the incoming administration.
   Israel was earmarked for $1.8 billion in military aid and $1.2
billion in economic assistance. The $3.0 billion total authorization
is the largest worldwide, exceeding the $2.3 billion recommended for
Egypt, which would receive $1.3 billion for military purposes and
$815 million in economic aid.
   In other authorization requests, the major recipients were the
countries with which the United States has base agreements: The
Philippines, $649.3, Turkey $613.5 million, Greece $350 million and
Portugal, $177.6 million.
   In Central America, major recipient countries included El
Salvador $386.1, Honduras $207.3 and Guatemala $158.6.

   President Reagan on Monday proposed increasing
by half a billion dollars the down payment on modernizing and
cleaning up the nation's atomic weapons complex _ a job expected to
cost $81 billion over the next 20 years.
   In his fiscal 1990 budget for the Energy Department, which makes
the nuclear warheads for the Pentagon, Reagan asked for $3.014
billion for modernization, environmental and safety programs at the
weapons plants. That is $478 million more than is being spent this
year.
   The proposal drew immediate criticism from Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio, who charged the Reagan budget was not enough to prevent
further environmental contamination, let alone clean up the mess
produced over the past 45 years.
   ``It's just a token of what is needed for cleanup,'' said Glenn,
who said it will take at least $1.8 billion a year ``to even just
get started.'' He urged President-elect Bush to do more.
   Deputy Energy Secretary Joseph F. Salgado told reporters the
department was ``dealing resolutely with our safety and
environmental problems'' and has established a process ``to address
this problem in the long term.''
   The department said it plans to seek a total of $18 billion over
the next five years to build new facilities and improve the existing
weapons complex of 17 major factories and laboratories in 12 states.
   According to budget documents, 60 percent of the Energy
Department's total $15 billion in requested spending authority is
devoted to research and production of nuclear weapons and Defense
Department projects.
   Energy officials were unable to provide a comprehensive detailed
breakdown of requested outlays _ money that would actually be spent
in the fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1.
   Those outlays usually run below the requested spending authority,
which includes planned expenditure obligations on multiyear projects.
   The department is requesting spending authority of $303.5 million
for designing two new nuclear reactors to replace three 35-year-old
reactors at its Savannah River Plant, in Aiken, S.C., which have
been shut down since last April for safety reasons.
   It is not clear when the department will restart the first of the
Savannah River reactors, which produce tritium, a fast-decaying
isotope of hydrogen that is needed for modern thermonuclear weapons.
   But as a replacement for the old reactors, the department is
proposing to build a new heavy water facility at Savannah River at
an estimated cost of $3.2 billion and a new gas-cooled reactor at
Idaho Falls, Idaho, costing $3.6 billion. Both would become
operational about the turn of the century.
   To clean up individual sites in the complex, the department is
requesting an increase in spending authority from $19 million this
year to $56 million in 1990 for Savannah River, from $50 million to
$55 million for the Feed Materials Production Center in Fernald,
Ohio, and from $28 million to $54 million for the Hanford site at
Richland, Wash.
   ``There has been no decision'' on shutting down Fernald or
another plant, Rocky Flats near Denver, Salgado told reporters.
Administration sources have said that the two might close at an
unspecified future date because they are near cities and would be
expensive to modernize.
   Energy Secretary John S. Herrington had asked the White House for
an additional $360 million to be spent by Sept. 30 of this year to
clean up the nuclear weapons complex, but the request was turned
down.
   Instead, White House Chief of Staff Kenneth N. Duberstein
authorized the department to allocate $150 million in unspent funds
for the cleanup effort.
   In documents sent to Congress last July, the department estimated
that the cleanup effort could cost up to $110 billion over the next
40 years.
   A more detailed classified study, the 2010 Report, estimated that
the costs will reach $81 billion over the next two decades,
according to administration and congressional sources familiar with
the document.
   That report envisaged a substantial increase in funding over
1989-90 levels, starting sometime in the 1990s.
   Of the total cleanup costs of $110 billion, nearly half or $46
billion would be spent at Hanford, which began operating as a top
secret facility in 1944 producing fuel for the first U.S. atomic
weapons, according to the report sent to Congress.

   Children swarmed onto a parade ground Monday
to say goodbye to the first of 3,000 Cuban soldiers scheduled to
leave by April 1 under a peace agreement for southern Africa.
   They thrust flowers into the hands of officers and soldiers as
Defense Minister Pedro Maria Tonha told the men assembled at the
training camp: ``Don't ever forget Angola, because you fought and
died here.''
   The first 450 Cubans are to depart Tuesday, in a symbolic
airlift, under terms of the agreement mediated by the United States
and signed Dec. 22 by Angola, Cuba and South Africa. The rest of the
3,000 troops are expected to return to Cuba by ship.
   Angola and Cuba have asked the United Nations to pay the
estimated $800 million cost of sending the estimated 50,000 Cubans
home from Angola.
   Their repatriation is part of a plan intended to bring peace to
southern Africa and independence to South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia, after U.N.-sponsored elections.
   Not included in the agreement are rebels fighting Angola's
Marxist government with U.S. and South African support, and the
South-West Africa People's Organization, a guerrilla group opposing
South African control of Namibia.
   Tonha decorated 13 ranking Cuban officers, including Gen. Raul
Menedez Tomassevic. Among those attending the ceremony were Gen.
Abelardo Colome Ibarra, vice minister of the Cuban armed forces, and
Gen. Pericles Ferreira Gomes of Brazil, head of the U.N. observers
who will monitor the withdrawal over 27 months.
   Cuban officials at the Funda camp 22 miles northeast of Luanda,
the capital, said the ceremony brought together the largest number
of Cuban officers ever assembled outside the Carribean island nation.
   Soldiers from Cuba arrived in July 1975, to support the
government that won control after independence from Portugal in its
battle with rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola.
   The United States has said it will continue military assistance
to UNITA until the government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
agrees to negotiate with the rebels.
   Brig. Gen. Rafael Moracen Limonta, who first came to Angola in
1965 as an adviser to Marxist guerrillas fighting the Portuguese,
said the departure was possible because South Africa agreed to
withdraw from southern Angola, where its forces pursued SWAPO
guerrillas, and allow independence in Namibia.
   ``The problem with UNITA is among the Angolans themselves,'' he
said, standing with other officers on the parade ground. ``We came
here because of the South Africans.''
   Angola and South Africa agreed to a cease-fire in southern Angola
on Aug. 8, and South African troops withdrew into Namibia.
   South Africa captured Namibia from Germany in World War I and
controlled it under a League of Nations mandate. The U.N. General
Assembly ended the mandate in 1966, but South Africa had refused to
leave.
   All but a token South African force is to withdraw from the
territory by Nov. 1, when Namibia is to hold its first free
legislative elections.
   Some questions remain about how 70 military and 20 civilian U.N.
observers will monitor the departure of Cuban troops from a country
14 times the size of Portugal.
   Gen. Ferreira Gomes said he would rely on the ``good word'' of
the Cubans and Angolans, but another military observer said
privately his mission is ``to count heads.''
   The observers are from Algeria, Brazil, Congo, India, Jordan,
Norway, Spain and Yugoslavia.

   Officials cleared a second company
alleged to have helped Libya build a chemical weapons plant, and a
ranking lawmaker said such accusations have totally discredited West
German businesses.
   A Finance Ministry spokesman in Bonn, the capital, said a probe
of the Hamburg-based Pen Tsao medical material company turned up
``no evidence they are connected in the Libyan affair.''
   Spokesman Walter Prax said the subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based
Pen Tsao was investigated by Hamburg-state officials from Jan. 3
through Jan. 7.
   Prax said in a telephone interview that the Finance Ministry
ordered the probe after Washington alleged that West German
companies were helping Libya build a chemical weapons plant in
Rabta, 60 miles south of Tripoli. Libya says the plant produces
pharmaceuticals.
   West German officials in the southern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg
last week announced no evidence was found connecting the
Imhausen-Chemie company in the Black Forest city of Lahr of being
involved with the Libyan plant.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz expressed his trust of
West Germany's handling of the probe to West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher in Paris over the weekend.
   But Hans Stercken, a federal lawmaker and member of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Party, said in a radio interview
that he was not satisfied.
   ``I say in all openness that it (Shultz's comments) doesn't
suffice for me'' Stercken said in an interview with the
Cologne-based Deutschlandfunk radio. ``This doesn't concern the good
intentions of the Federal Republic, which no one has seriously
questioned.
   ``What it concerns is that businesses in the Federal Republic
(West Germany) have been totally discredited,'' said the lawmaker,
who heads Parliament's foreign affairs committee.
   He said the United States has not supplied details about the
American suspicions as requested. West German and U.S. officials
were expected to meet this week to review the allegations.
   Stercken also said the issue should not have come to a head
through the American media and that the United States and West
Germany should have had more communication about the U.S.
allegations.
   ``One cannot deal with each other in this manner,'' he said.
   U.S. media reported last week that in addition to West German
companies, Italian and Japanese firms were supplying Libya with
material and know-how to build the plant.

   In a valedictory speech, Secretary of State
George P. Shultz on Monday night condemned leaks and lies in
government and ``the old American inclination to withdraw from the
world.''
   Apart from the criticism, Shultz said he was leaving his post
after more than six years convinced that ``ours is a winning hand.''
   Shultz said the United States was approaching a new era in
international affairs in a world that had undergone significant
changes:
   _ Fear of nuclear war was greatly diminished.
   _ A new U.S.-Soviet relationship promised to reduce tensions and
to increase cooperation in solving world problems.
   _ A new global economy based on information and openness was
replacing old divisions based on national borders and ancient
rivalries.
   _ Human rights, the rule of law and the practice of democracy
were taking root and spreading.
   Shultz, who first came to Washington more than 30 years ago, said
he would go home to California next week convinced that America ``is
lighting the way for the hopes and aspirations of countless millions
around the world.''
   His remarks were prepared for delivery at a reception given for
him at the State Department by the Citizens Network for Foreign
Affairs, a private group.
   While most of Shultz's speech was positive, he said ``some things
are worse,'' including a steady erosion in the precepts of public
service.
   Shultz criticized ``declinists,'' or those who ``play to the idea
that America no longer has anything to give the world.''
   Without specifying any particular individual or group, Shultz
said ``they touch on the old American inclination to withdraw from
the world in order to regain economic or moral security.''
   Shultz said their ideas should be rejected.
   Also, he criticized ``a dangerous loss of trust'' within the
government. Specifically, Shultz scored infighters in the executive
branch who use ``leaks and lies'' to influence decisions.
   ``Our decisions should be fairly made, and once they are, they
should be carried out, like it or not,'' Shultz said.
   ``You live up to your oath of office not just by carrying out
decisions you agree with, but by carrying out decisions you don't
agree wtih _ or else resigning.''
   Again, Shultz gave no examples.
   During his stay at the State Department he offered to resign
three times _ over proposed lie-detector tests; a mission he was not
aware of to the Middle East by Robert C. McFarlane, then the White
House national security adviser, and his inability to secure a plane
for an overseas assignment.
   On the other hand, Shultz privately opposed the decision by
President Reagan to approve secret U.S. arms sales to Iran but did
not threaten to quit.

<HEAD>Justice Department To Sue To Block Proposed Joint Ventures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department announced Monday it will
sue to block two proposed joint ventures between Westinghouse
Electric Corp. and a Swiss company.
   The ventures between Westinghouse and Asea Brown Boveri Inc. of
Zurich would involve the manufacture and sale of electric power
generation, transmission and distribution products.
   ``The proposed joint ventures pose significant threats to
competition in equipment and services necessary for this country's
production of electric power,'' said Charles F. Rule, assistant
attorney general in charge of the antitrust division.
   As a result, ``the reduction of competition in these markets
would likely mean higher electric rates for all users of electricity
and higher prices for many products manufactured using
electricity,'' Rule said.
   If the anti-competitive aspects can be resolved through a
restructuring of the joint ventures, the antitrust division still
would file a civil lawsuit, but it would be accompanied by a consent
decree incorporating the changes which settle the suit, Rule said.
   Westinghouse spokesman Jim Schmitt said that ``the negotiations
are continuing that may enable the transactions to go forward.''
   Under the joint ventures announced by Westinghouse in April 1988,
Westinghouse would hold 55 percent and ABB 45 percent in each
partnership, Schmitt said.
   ``In both cases, each partner will contribute the manufacturing
plants and engineering and marketing organizations of its involved
operations,'' he said. ``In addition, Westinghouse will receive
about $500 million from ABB for the two partnership interests.''
   A Justice Department statement said competitive concerns caused
by one of the ventures focus on power transformers used by electric
utilities to convert electricity to different voltages so that it
can be transmitted efficiently over long distances. The combined
power transformer sales of Westinghouse and ABB would exceed 50
percent of total U.S. sales, which were more than $400 million in
1988, the department said.
   The concern with the second venture focused on the manufacture
and sale of steam turbine generators and the sale of major repair
services on existing turbine generating equipment, Rule said.
   Westinghouse, ABB, and General Electric of Fairfield, Conn., are
the three leading U.S. suppliers of medium and large steam turbine
generators.
   Westinghouse and ABB are two of only four significant sellers of
major turbine generator repair and related services to U.S.
utilities, along with GE and Utility Power Corp., a subsidiary of
Siemens A.G. of West Germany, Rule said. U.S. sales of steam turbine
generators and the pertinent services are estimated at over $600
million per year.
   Schmitt would not disclose the portion of each market held by
Westinghouse.

   An Indian woman says she is going to make
the long flight home to her native country despite a fear of flying
brought on by the loss of five members of her husband's family on
Pan Am Flight 103.
   Prachi Dixit's husband, Sunil, a graduate physics student at the
University of Notre Dame, lost an aunt and uncle, and three cousins
when the Pan Am flight en route from London to New York exploded
Dec. 21 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   Mrs. Dixit still plans to travel next month with her 20-month-old
son to her home in Agra, the site of the Taj Mahal.
   She admits she is concerned about her safety on the
trans-Atlantic trip, but that concern is tempered by the prospect of
a family reunion and by her religious faith, she said Monday.
   ``I'm excited to see my family,'' she said.
   ``I believe in God and that whatever he does is his decision, so
I'm not really worried about getting there,'' she said.
   Still, the tragedy of Flight 103 is with her. She returned last
week from Fairborn, Ohio, and services for the members of her
husband's family.
   The uncle, Om Dikshit, a professor at Wright State University;
his wife, Shanti; their daughter Garima Rattan; and her children,
Anmol and Suruchi, boarded Flight 103 in Frankfurt, West Germany,
after apparently missing an earlier flight, said Mrs. Dixit. She
spells her name differently from her uncle's.
   ``For 20 hours, we were told by Pan Am that they were not on the
flight,'' she said.
   Two members of the family flew to Lockerbie to bring the bodies
back to Ohio, she said. Other family members already have flown the
remains to India for final services.
   The grieving family was supported by friends in Ohio who brought
meals to the home in Fairborn and attended the funeral, said Ms.
Dixit.
   ``Even people at the funeral home were in tears,'' she said.
   She returned Friday to her job as a day-care teacher at First
Presbyterian Church, and to the comfort of happy children.
   ``They are so full of life,'' she said. ``It's soothing.''

   Japan's new emperor said Monday he will help
safeguard the democratic constitution, and leftist politicians urged
vigilance against any government effort to use the monarchy for
``reactionary'' ends.
   One Communist and five Socialist legislators boycotted the
ceremony at which Emperor Akihito pledged himself to the
constitution imposed by the United States after World War II, but
two Socialists did attend.
   Those who stayed away said the monarchy's close links to the
Shinto religion violates the constitutional separation of state and
religion. They were invited in their capacities as chairmen of
parliamentary committees.
   Outside the imperial palace, nearly 315,000 mourners signed
registers of condolence Monday for Emperor Hirohito, who died of
cancer Saturday at age 87. His 62-year reign was marked by the rise
of militarism, defeat in the war and Japan's emergence as a leading
economic power.
   One mourner outside, 36-year-old pianist Yumiko Ideta, said of
the new imperial era: ``I and many of my generation think it will be
a good chance for Akihito to do the things his father wasn't able to
do. We know that the emperor has been manipulated politically since
Meiji times (1867-1912) and we'll have to address the problem during
Akihito's reign and afterward.''
   Akihito, 55, is expected to be closer to the people than his
father, who was considered a living god until he renounced the
concept of imperial divinity after World War II.
   On Monday, in his first speech as emperor, Akihito said he would
continue on Hirohito's path, ``making his desire to constantly be at
one with the people my desire as well, joining together with you to
preserve the constitution of Japan.''
   He reaffirmed the limits placed on his role by the constitution,
which makes him ``a symbol of the state and the unity of the
people.'' His duties are ceremonial, consisting of signing bills
into law and meeting foreign dignitaries.
   By emphasizing the constitution drawn up in the U.S. occupation
of 1945-52, Akihito was expected to win praise from liberals. They
have criticized recent attempts by rightist members of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party to revise the document and declare the
emperor ``head'' of the nation.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita pledged to work within the
``constitution of Japan and with the emperor, the symbol of unity of
the people, to make Japan open to the world.''
   Analysts said optimism about Emperor Akihito's new era helped
boost the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key indicator, the Nikkei Stock
Average of 225 selected issues, up 468.85 points to a record high
30,678.39 on Monday.
   The new emperor spoke somberly for four minutes in the formal
ceremony attended by Takeshita and 237 members of the imperial
family, government, parliament and judiciary.
   ``Shrouded in sorrow and overwhelmed by the awesome
responsibilities I undertake, I stand humbly before you,'' Akihito
said. At his side were Empress Michiko, 54, and their 28-year-old
son, Crown Prince Naruhito.
   Eizo Kobayashi, a senior Communist Party official, told reporters
later: ``No matter what the new emperor says, we must realize the
possible danger of his role. Our task now is to oppose reactionary,
political use of the emperor and to promote the peaceful clauses of
the postwar constitution.''
   Opposition political parties also say government sponsorship of
some of the numerous rites honoring Hirohito, with their Shinto
practices, violates the constitution.
   Hirohito will be buried Feb. 24 in an imperial mausoleum in
Hachioji, a western suburb, after a state funeral in the Shinjuku
Gyoen Imperial Gardens and a public procession.
   In one of about 60 funeral and transition rites, Emperor Akihito
paid final respects to his father Monday and palace officials sealed
Hirohito's body, in a coffin of Japanese cypress, inside a copper
container, news reports said.
   Officials said slightly more than 1 million mourners had visited
the palace in central Tokyo since Saturday to sign the condolence
books, and about 350,000 had signed 11 other registers around the
country.
   Two old soldiers hanged themselves Saturday and Sunday, leaving
suicide notes saying they wanted to follow the emperor in death.
   Teinosuke Watanabe, an 82-year-old retired company president,
said after signing the palace condolence register Monday: ``For my
generation, the emperor was an honorable man. In his own way he has
admitted responsibility for the war ... traveling around the country
to meet the people as they rebuilt.
   ``By living, he has borne the heavy burden of war
responsibility.''
   How much responsibility Hirohito bore has been a matter of
controversy, but historians generally agree he was a figurehead with
too little power to do anything but approve decisions of military
leaders.

<HEAD>Reagan Would Boost AIDS Spending But Curb Medicare and Medicaid</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 4 grafs after 4th graf pvs, bgng: President Reagan,
to add reaction</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration on Monday proposed to
boost spending for AIDS research and prevention by 13 percent but to
reduce the growth of the Medicare and Medicaid health programs by
cutting payments to states, hospitals and physicians.
   Overall, the budget of the Department of Health and Human
Services _ the largest federal department _ would increase 5.7
percent to $424.4 billion in fiscal 1990. HHS spending accounts for
about 37 percent of the federal budget.
   Medicare and Medicaid have been fueling the growth of the
department's budget. Medicare has been growing faster than the
number of beneficiaries and far more rapidly than inflation, even
inflation in medical prices. Between 1980 and 1989, Medicare has
grown about 12 percent annually, while Medicaid is growing at 13
percent a year.
   President Reagan said his proposed cutbacks would not reduce
benefits to the 56 million elderly, disabled and low-income people
in the two programs, but would force the states, which administer
Medicaid, and providers paid by Medicare to become more efficient
and reduce waste.
   Reagan's critics, however, say the Medicaid cutbacks, which will
reduce grants to states by 3 percent, will curtail medical services
for the poor.
   ``Unless states have or are willing to come up with more money,
which many aren't, their only options are to restrict eligibility,
reduce medical services or reduce fees paid to doctors,'' said
Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, a nonprofit group that researches policy issues
affecting the low-income.
   ``In substantial part, it will be passed along in benefit
reductions,'' he said.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the House health
subcommittee, said the Medicaid cutbacks ``put the states in a
financially untenable situation'' that will result in less coverage
to low-income families.
   Reagan said the fight against the spread of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome continues to be the nation's top public health
priority. An estimated 1 million to 1.5 million people in the United
States are infected with the deadly virus though not all have
developed symptoms yet.
   Reagan proposed $160 million more for AIDS research, which would
bring spending in fiscal 1990 to $1.4 billion, a 13 percent increase
over current outlays.
   HHS Secretary Otis Bowen had pushed for a 39 percent increase
over the 1989 budget authority of $1.3 billion, but the proposed
spending plan would increase spending authority by only 24 percent
to $1.6 billion for fiscal 1990. Budget authority totals can be
spent over more than one year.
   The department also estimated an additional $925 million would be
spent on treatment and income support to AIDS victims through
Medicaid, Medicare, Disability Insurance and other income and
service programs.
   More than 82,000 AIDS cases have been reported in the United
States since 1981. By the end of 1992, the administration said,
reported AIDS cases in this country are expected to reach 365,000,
with 80,000 new cases and 65,000 AIDS deaths projected for that year
alone.
   The budget proposal also increases basic biomedical research by
6.6 percent to $8.5 million. Included is $100 million for a project
to map the human genome, the biological blueprint that determines
individual characteristics and that also can cause disease.
   More than 94 percent of HHS spending is earmarked for entitlement
programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, over which the
agency has little budget control since eligibility for the programs
is set by Congress.
   Reagan's budget protects Social Security benefits but proposes
changes that would require approval by Congress to reduce the rapid
growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending.
   Hospitals ``have a lot of profit margin'' with which to absorb
the reductions and states ``need to examine how they are running
their Medicaid programs, not necessarily cut back benefits,'' said
Elizabeth Cusick, director of the division of health benefits in the
office of the HHS secretary.
   ``We want to encourage them to find ways to control costs,'' she
said.
   Without any changes, the Medicare budget, which pays for the
health care of about 34 million elderly and disabled Americans,
would grow by 14 percent in fiscal 1990. However, Reagan is
proposing to trim that growth rate to 10 percent by cutting $3.5
billion from fees paid to physicians and hospitals. The Medicare
budget would total $94.9 billion.
   About a third of the Medicare cut, $1 billion, would come from
cuts in payments to teaching hospitals, which receive additional
reimbursements to cover their costs of training interns and
residents.
   Also, capital payments to hospitals would be cut for a savings of
$620 million and reduced fees to physicians for certain procedures,
including radiology, anesthesiology and surgery, that are considered
``overpriced'' would save about $350 million.
   A new part of Medicare is the Catastrophic Health Insurance
program, which is intended to be entirely self-supporting. It is
financed by premiums paid by Medicare recipients, which are
projected to total about $8.6 billion in fiscal 1990. The program is
projected to spend $4 billion in that year.
   Growth in Medicaid _ the program that rovides health care for
about 26 million low-income Americans _ would be 9 percent without
changes in the program next year. The administration is proposing to
slice that to 5 percent growth with cuts totalling about $1.4
billion for a spending a total of $36 billion.
   Much of the reduction would come from reducing payments to the
states, which administer the program under federal guidelines, by
about $1.1 billion.
   Benefits under the Social Security program are protected and the
administration projects a cost-of-living adjustment of 3.6 percent
in January 1990.
   Currently, a newly retired 65-year-old can receive a maximum of
$899 per month in Social Security benefits. A 3.6 percent increase
would put the maximum at $931 next year.

   The Environmental Protection Agency said Monday
it is considering charging the chemical industry a fee for the right
to produce chlorofluorocarbons as an attempt to spur the phasing out
of such production.
   Under international treaty, production of chlorofluorocarbons, or
CFCs, is to be curtailed to l986 levels next July and cut in half by
l998. The chemical is widely blamed for depletion of the world's
atmospheric ozone.
   In its fiscal l990 budget, announced Monday, the EPA said it
plans to propose charging the chemical industry ``market value for
the rights to produce CFCs and related ozone-depleting substances.''
   EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas told reporters the agency has yet
to determine precisely what mechanism will be used to determine the
fee, which he said is expected to produce about $400 million in
revenue.
   Under various proposals under consideration, the government could
charge a fee for a certain volume of CFCs produced or could auction
off production permits, officials suggested.
   In either case, the federal fee structure is expected to keep
producers from reaping windfall profits as the available volume of
CFCs is reduced in the coming years. Federal officials fear high
profits would work against the industry rapidly developing
substitute products.
   Producers of CFCs immediately criticized the plan, although it is
still in the preliminary stages of development.
   ``The government proposal is a blatant, illegal tax on an
industry that is striving to restructure through an orderly
transition to alternative products,'' said a statement issued by the
DuPont Company, which is the world's largest producer of CFCs.
   The company said either a permit fee or an auction on permits
``will likely result in dislocations in the supply of these
important chemicals.''
   The EPA last summer also said in a preliminary regulatory
proposal that some kind of permit and fee structure might be
necessary to prevent CFC producers from taking in windfall profits
and, thereby, slowing down the phasing out of CFC production.
   Because of the concern about ozone depletion, the nation's of the
world have agreed that the production of chlorofluorocarbons are to
be phased out.
   CFCs are used for a variety of purposes including as a coolant in
air conditioning units and refrigerators, in Halon gas fire
extinguishers, in the production of styrofome, and in many countries
as a propellant in spray cans.
   DuPont said that annually $28 billion in goods and services and
$135 billion worth of equipment depend on CFCs in some way.

   Legislators pledged on Monday they would grill
the Treasury over office expenses after reports said Finance
Minister Shimon Peres planned to have taxpayers pay for his ironing.
   The controversy came days after Peres pushed through a $600
million economic austerity plan that raised prices for basics such
as milk and bread.
   An outcry arose over a report in the Haaretz newspaper that the
Finance Ministry planned to increase its budget by at least $350,000
to fund special privileges for Peres and his aides. Almost $90,000
was allocated to Peres' personal services, such as ironing, catering
and photographs, the paper wrote.
   Finance Ministry spokesman Avi Gil said on Monday that Peres
``didn't see the budget proposal, was not asked about it and didn't
approve it.''
   He said when Peres found out about the draft after the Haaretz
publication, ``he canceled it immediately.''
   But Yossi Sarid, a legislator for the opposition Citizens Rights
Movement, said the ministry only backed away on Monday because of
the public clamor.
   The latest proposal calls for one mobile car telephone instead of
three, and grants a senior aide a Ford Sierra instead of a Volvo,
said Sarid.
   ``The other items, such as ironing and so on, will remain in the
budget, but the expenses for the photographer will be halved from
$26,000 to $13,000,'' Sarid said, adding that items like ironing
were ``highly irregular.''
   ``They won't make or break the state economy, but when everyone's
talking about tightening the belt and austerity, it's a matter of
principle,'' he said.
   Sarid said the new budget allocation would total $34,000, less
than one-tenth of the original. Besides personal items, the initial
$350,000 figure was to cover services and overtime payments for
Peres aides, Haaretz wrote.
   Gil refused comment on Sarid's remarks.
   Guided by a Finance Ministry proposal, the Cabinet decided last
Thursday to slash the state budget by $600 million. The cuts meant
drastic price increases on subsidized foodstuffs such as milk, bread
and yogurt, and additional charges for public high school tuition
and doctors' visits.
   Political figures from right and left assailed the Finance
Ministry perquisites.
   Rafael Eitan of the ultraright Tzomet Party said Peres was
setting a bad personal example and Ran Cohen of the left-wing
Citizens Rights Movement demanded that Peres reduce his budget by 15
percent rather than raise it.
   The parliamentary Finance Committee did not discuss the
controversy during its meeting Monday, but chairman Ariel Weinstein
told The Associated Press: ``I got the feeling it will become an
important issue.''
   He said the committee would demand a detailed breakdown of the
Finance Ministry's budget, although the law does not require
ministries to submit their budgets for approval.
   A Labor Party official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
blamed the misstep on Peres' aides and said it would weaken Peres
within the party, whose younger generation has been challenging his
leadership.

   Officials said Monday both engines of a
new Boeing 737 apparently failed, causing the plane to crash beside
Britain's main north-south highway and kill 44 people.
   Transport Minister Paul Channon said sabotage was not suspected
in the crash Sunday of the British Midland Airways jet, the second
air disaster in Britain in less than three weeks. Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher said, however, that no possible cause could be
ruled out, including sabotage.
   The Scandinavian airline SAS, part owner of British Midland,
received a bomb threat against it and its subsidiaries eight days
ago, but spokesman John Herbert said Monday in Stockholm no link
with the crash was suspected.
   One aviation expert called the double engine failure a 10
million-to-1 chance.
   Leicestershire police revised the death toll downward to 44 on
Monday night. An earlier report of 46 fatalities resulted from
confusion in counting bodies at several mortuaries, said a police
spokeswoman who by custom was not identified.
   Eighty-two passengers and crew members _ all of the survivors of
the crash _ were injured, including 43-year-old pilot Kevin Hunt,
who was hailed as a hero for managing to miss crashing on the
village of Kegworth or the M1 highway.
   The jet, en route from London to Belfast, plowed into a grassy
embankment on the highway Sunday night as the pilot struggled to
make an emergency landing at East Midlands Airport, about 100 miles
north of London. He missed the runway by about half a mile.
   ``So far the evidence, although by no means conclusive, is
consistent with the right engine having stopped before impact and
there are also signs of fire in the left engine,'' Channon told
BBC-TV.
   Asked whether both engines malfunctioned, he replied: ``That
certainly looks probable at the moment.''
   The Boeing 737-400, delivered to British Midland just 12 weeks
ago, had flown less than 500 hours, the airline said. Boeing said
the plane had two CFM-56 engines, built in France by a consortium of
the U.S.-based General Electric Co. and the French company SNECMA.
   SNECMA spokesman Olivier Fagard said he did not know whether both
engines failed.
   ``It is extremely improbable that both engines would break down
in such a short interval,'' Fagard said in Paris. ``We have very
impressive reliability statistics. There ws a fire in engine No. 1,
which was controlled. There was no fire in the other.''
   William Tench, retired head of Britain's Air Accidents
Investigation Board, said the odds against both engines failing on a
Boeing 737 were about 10 million to 1. He suggested there had been a
``technical mistake such as something incorrect being done to the
engines during turnaround (servicing between flights), either
inadvertently or deliberately.''
   Freddie Yetman, spokesman for the British Airline Pilots'
Association, said a double-engine failure was ``astonishing.''
   ``You just don't train for something like this. You work on the
assumption that there will always be an engine working,'' he said.
   Mrs. Thatcher inspected the wreckage of the blue aircraft
crumpled among roadside trees, and visited survivors at Derby Royal
Infirmary.
   Asked whether sabotage was suspected, she replied: ``We rule out
nothing _ we simply can't.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said she ``almost couldn't believe it'' when she
heard about the crash, so soon after a bomb blew apart Pan Am Flight
103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on Dec. 21, killing all 259
people on board and 11 on the ground.
   The Rev. Ian Paisley, the hard-line Northern Ireland Protestant
leader who comforted relatives of the injured on a special flight
from Belfast, also said sabotage should not be ruled out.
   ``It is very suspicious looking because this flight is used by
servicemen,'' he said.
   While soldiers are a frequent target of Irish guerrillas in
Northern Ireland, civilian airliners have never been known to be
attacked.
   Authorities said 25 soldiers stationed in Northern Ireland were
on the flight. Four died, along with at least two Northern Ireland
police officers.
   Investigators searched the wreckage and recovered the flight
recorders Monday. Investigators from Boeing and General Electric
flew here to help in the inquiry.
   Passengers had just been served a light dinner when the plane got
into trouble shortly after leaving London's Heathrow Airport.
   Gareth Jones, 38, said some women passengers wept as the pilot
told them: ``Prepare for a crash landing.''
   As the plane started descending on one engine, Jones said, sparks
began flying from its remaining engine.
   Gilmore Stevenson, 45, told Mrs. Thatcher that it was ``very,
very noisy. ``I'll never forget that noise. We had the sensation of
cartwheeling and I ended up hanging upside-down in my seatbelt. I
was strung up like a turkey.''
   Stevenson said he agonized in the dark over whether to release
his seatbelt and risk being injured when he fell from his seat. By
the time he decided to free himself, he hardly had the strength to
lift his arm to the buckle.
   ``I eventually managed to release the belt and I fell down. It
was only a matter of feet _ I just lay there in a heap.''
   Stevenson said his wife, Vivienne, helped other passengers escape
and he was rescued by firefighters.

<HEAD>Court Allows Defense Lawyers To Strike Blacks From Klan Murder Jury</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARRY MITCHELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOBILE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday allowed
criminal defendants to exclude potential jurors because of their
race, clearing the way for an all-white jury in a case involving a
black man's murder by Ku Klux Klan members.
   The court, over two dissenting votes, rejected arguments by
Alabama prosecutors _ supported by law enforcement officials
nationwide _ that defense lawyers unlawfully are seeking to bar
blacks from a jury in the Klan case in Mobile.
   Justices Byron R. White and Anthony M. Kennedy voted to hear
arguments in the case but four votes are needed to grant such review.
   Mobile County District Attorney Chris Galanos said defense
lawyers should have to follow the same legal guidelines as
prosecutors in not removing potential jurors simply because of the
color of their skin. He also said it's ``absurd'' for defense
lawyers to argue that black jurors cannot be fair to white
defendants.
   But Neil Hanley, a defense attorney in the Klan case, said the
Constitution prohibits ``governmental discrimination'' against
defendants and he was not surprised by the court's action.
   ``I can strike whomever I please (from the jury), based on what's
in the best interest of my client,'' Hanley said. ``I've never
argued that blacks cannot give whites a fair trial.''
   Assistant Alabama Attorney General Ed Carnes said Monday that
Attorney General Don Siegelman instructed him to prepare legislation
that would make it a matter of state law that defense attorneys
could not discriminate on the basis of race.
   Carnes said the Supreme Court, by declining to review the case,
left open the possibility that such a state law may yet pass muster
if the issue reaches the high court again.
   The matter before the high court was whether a 1986 Supreme Court
ruling against racial discrimination in jury selection applies to
defendants as well as prosecutors.
   The court in 1986 ruled that prosecutors may not disqualify
potential jurors based on their race.
   The ruling, which overturned a black man's conviction by an
all-white jury in Kentucky, established that the Constitution's
equal-protection guarantees bar racially motivated jury selection by
prosecutors. But the decision left unanswered whether the same
guarantees apply when defense lawyers seek to mold the racial
make-up of the jury.
   Monday's action involved the case of the March 21, 1981, killing
of Michael Donald, 19, who was abducted from a Mobile street, beaten
to death and his body hanged from a tree.
   Prosecutors said he was the random victim of a Klan hunting party
retaliating for a jury's inability to reach a verdict in the trial
of a black man accused of murdering a white police officer.
   Two Klan members were convicted in the slaying. Henry Francis
Hays was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. James ``Tiger''
Knowles pleaded guilty to a federal charge of violating Donald's
civil rights and was sentenced to life in prison.
   Mobile County prosecutors then charged Hays' father, Bennie Jack
Hays, and Benjamin Franklin Cox with aiding and abetting the murder.
The elder Hays and Cox are former KKK members.
   An all-white jury had been impaneled. The defense attorneys had
disqualified all 16 blacks among 65 prospective jurors. But Bennie
Hays collapsed in court last February, prompting a mistrial for both
defendants.
   Before the retrial, prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court to
test whether blacks may be excluded in a similar fashion again.
   Mobile County Circuit Judge Michael E. Zoghby ruled last May that
``under the law as it now exists, defendants do not have to give a
reason for the exercise of their peremptory challenges.'' The
Alabama Supreme Court refused to disturb the judge's decision.

   An Australian duo Monday ended the debate
over which college has the most persuasive students, winning
debating's most prestigious tournament for the University of Sydney
Union for the second time.
   The Sydney team triumphed over the University of Toronto and 114
other pairs of word wizards to capture the 9th Annual World
Universities Debating Championship at Princeton University.
   Two U.S. teams, from Yale University and the University of
Pennsylvania, were eliminated in the semi-final round Monday morning.
   Using a forceful debating style mixed with wit, the Sydney team
was the clear crowd favorite as debaters Warren Lee and Andrew Bell
argued that modern society reveres those who acquire wealth.
   University of Toronto team members Justin MacGregor and David
Conklin, acting as ``the government'' in the British parliamentary
style argument, had the task of proving that ``it profits a man
nothing to gain the world and lose his soul.''
   ``It was a good debate,'' a confident Lee said after the
Australian team finished its work. ``The masses were laughing and
hooting and screaming. You always like to see that.''
   Conklin admitted the subject ``was a tough one. Any value today
involving some notion of justice or injustice is difficult to get
across.''
   In the debate, Conklin argued that figures such as Jesus, Gandhi
and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. shunned the material world for
larger social gains.
   ``Christ, in his death, was far more important than he would have
been had he compromised his values,'' Conklin said.
   The Australian team, however, argued that today's society does
not punish those who acquire wealth.
   ``Let's look at the real world,'' Lee said. ``People don't say,
`Let's all join the Peace Corps and be nice guys.'''
   MacGregor scored a few points by saying ``justice was served in
the movie `Wall Street.' Michael Douglas did go to jail in the end,
before he won his Academy Award.''
   But it wasn't enough to overcome the Australians' contention
``that the people who get the stuff are not punished, they get the
wealth, the repsect, and the happiness.''
   Earlier in the day, the Australian team defeated the team from
Yale University in the semi-finals by opposing the concept that
``the emperor has no clothes.''
   The University of Toronto advanced to the championship round by
defeating the University of Pennsylvania with a successful argument
that the sky is not falling.
   The debating championship, held at Princeton University for the
second time in the tournament's nine-year history, drew a record 232
participants from 18 nations.
   The debaters have delivered some spirited arguments during the
week-long tournament.
   For exampled, Cheryl Strauss of Cornell University last week
suggested that vegetables be the focal point of a new religion.
   ``I think we should all pray to vegetables,'' she said. ``Then we
could all look down and that would make us feel good.''
   Mark Voyce, a debater from the University of Maryland, had an
offbeat response Sunday when given the topic, ``How to Make Sports
More Violent.''
   Voyce said archery should include human targets.
   ``Who wants to shoot an arrow into a bunch of hay?'' he said.

   A Royal Air Force Phantom jet fighter
crashed in the North Sea on Monday during a training mission, and
the pilot was believed dead, the air force said.
   An RAF spokesman, Squadron Leader Pat Coffey, said an RAF
helicopter picked up the second crewman, the navigator, from a
dinghy. He said the man suffered back injuries in the crash, 52
miles off the eastern Scotland port city of Dundee.
   The jet had taken off from Leuchars in the eastern county of
Fife, an air force training base.
   Coffey said the search for the pilot was called off as a result
of ``strong evidence that he did not survive.'' Coffey did not
elaborate.
   The crash occurred at 4:15 p.m. (11:15 a.m. EST), the spokesman
said. He said another Phantom flying in the area spotted the
navigator's parachute and he was picked up about 35 minutes later.

   The judge in the Iran-Contra case directed
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on Monday to certify that national
security concerns would prevent a fair public trial of the key
charges against former White House aide Oliver L. North.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell said he would not grant
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh's motion to dismiss conspiracy
and theft charges until the attorney general made clear in an
affidavit that the decision against allowing certain classified
information to be released during any trial was made by high Reagan
administration officials.
   ``I have a question in my mind as to whether or not this is a
motion that can only be made by the attorney general,'' Gesell said
at a hearing.
   Walsh, who met with Thornburgh last Wednesday and told him he was
going to seek dismissal of the two central charges, said, ``I am
quite sure I could get an affidavit'' from the attorney general.
Gesell said he hopes to receive it by Thursday.
   Justice Department spokesman Loye Miller declined to comment on
whether the attorney general would provide an affidavit, but a
department source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he
assumed the attorney general probably will submit one.
   Meanwhile, Walsh disclosed he plans to call former U.S. Rep.
Michael Barnes, D-Md., and beer magnate Joseph Coors to testify
against North. Their names were on a revised list of prosecution
witnesses, which have been reduced in number from 87 to 40 because
of the plans to dismiss the conspiracy and theft charges. Coors and
Barnes weren't on the original list.
   Coors, after meeting with North in June 1985, provided a $65,000
donation to supply the Contras with a Maule aircraft and two months
later Barnes inquired about North's activities on behalf of the
Contras. Barnes received a response denying that the National
Security Council staff had provided fund-raising or military support
to the Contras.
   North prepared the response, according to two counts in the
indictment of the former National Security Council aide charging him
with obstruction of congress and making false statements. Barnes at
the time was chairman of the House subcommittee on western
hemisphere affairs.
   Also among the new names on the prosecution's witness list is
William Langton, president of Southern Air Transport, a former CIA
proprietary that was involved in both supplying the Contras and in
the administration's secret arms sales to Iran.
   Walsh disclosed at the hearing that he acted to dismiss the two
counts last Thursday after receiving letters in December from
Thornburgh and CIA Director William Webster discussing the problem
of disclosing classified information in the North case.
   The Dec. 22 attorney general's letter actually was written by
Assistant Attorney General Edward S.G. Dennis Jr., head of the
criminal division, and noted that heads of intelligence agencies had
identified material that ``posed a substantial threat to national
security and could not be disclosed at trial.''
   The decision represented ``the unanimous view of the intelligence
community,'' Dennis wrote. A copy of the letter was released at the
Justice Department after Gesell's hearing.
   Prosecutors asked Gesell Dec. 22 to reconsider his guidelines for
presenting classified information in prosecution exhibits. The
judge's refusal last Tuesday to take that step triggered Walsh's
trip to Thornburgh's office at the Justice Department, where the
indpendent counsel told the attorney general he would seek dismissal
of the conspiracy and theft counts.
   At the hearing, Walsh said his motion to dismiss was prompted by
the ``irresolution of the conflict'' with intelligence agencies over
releasing documents.
   Gesell said that under the Classified Information Procedures Act,
the attorney general should represent the executive branch in
detailing problems that disclosing classified information would
present.
   ``The decision of whether or not to release them seems to me to
be a high government responsibility and not a prosecutorial
responsibility,'' said Gesell.
   Gesell said the affidavit detailing the government's position
would be presented to the court under seal.
   North is still confronted with felony charges that could carry
prison terms totaling as much as 60 years if he were to be convicted
on all counts.
   These include obstructing various congressional and presidential
inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair by preparing false statements
and destroying documents.
   The head of the prosecution team, John Keker, estimated it would
take six to eight weeks to present the government's case, while
North lawyer Brendan Sullivan estimated the defense part of the case
would take two to three months.
   ``It's going to be a wonderful summer,'' Gesell said.

<HEAD>Shining Path Guerrillas Kill 17</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AYACUCHO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maoist guerrillas killed 12 peasants in
revenge raids on two villages and attacked a court motorcade,
slaying a judge and four other officials, police said Monday.
   The violence, the latest in the Shining Path guerrilla group's
bloody eight-year insurgency, occurred Sunday in remote areas of the
Andes Mountains.
   Near Chaluanca, a town in Apurimac state 280 miles southeast of
Lima, a column of Shining Path ambushed the motorcade with automatic
weapons and explosives, police said. They said a provincial court
judge, a government attorney and three police guards were killed.
   Police escorting the court officials to Chaluanca on state
business drove off the attackers, authorities said.
   Officials said 20 Shining Path attacked the farming settlement of
Rumichaca, 40 miles east of Ayacucho, shooting and stabbing to death
six men and one woman and torching several of the village's 50 homes.
   Hours later, the same rebel group swept through the nearby hamlet
of Huchuas and killed four men and one women in a similar raid,
authorities said.
   Police said the Mao-inspired Shining Path was retaliating because
the villages formed self-defense patrols to resist the guerrillas
and provided government troops food and information on rebel
activities.
   Ayacucho, the capital of Ayacucho state, is 225 miles southeast
of Lima.
   Rebels have killed hundreds of peasants they suspect of being
patrol members since the military organized the groups early in the
decade in villages across Ayacucho state.
   Ayacucho, Apurmiac and other states in the central and southern
Andean highlands are populated by Quechua-speaking Indians who live
in isolated hamlets.
   The region, where customs have remained unchanged for centuries,
was the birthplace and remains the focus of the Shining Path
insurgency, which has claimed 12,000 lives.

   An Israeli hotel lost a kosher license because
of a New Year's party involving a couple who simulated a sexual act
inside a flying helicopter hovering outside the hotel's windows, the
manager said Monday.
   Israeli newspapers said the couple was having sex in the
chopper's open doorway, and the daily Yediot carried a photograph
Monday showing a woman and a man who appeared engaged in a sexual
act in a helicopter.
   But Doron Gilboa of the Club Hotel in the city of Tiberias said
the couple was in fact dressed and only simulated a sexual act.
   ``They were wearing transparent clothes and only hugged, kissed
and fondled each other,'' he said. ``You cannot make love in the
cold we had then, and what's more, inside a helicopter.''
   Gilboa told The Associated Press the entire hotel was rented for
a three-day private New Year party. He said an arrangement was made
with a man who offered a helicopter for a laser show.
   ``Apparently, something went wrong and the man decided to bring a
pair of performers. He acted without our approval, and we are
considering taking steps against him,'' Gilboa said.
   On Jan. 2, Gilboa said, Tiberias Chief Rabbi David Peretz told
him that the hotel's kosher license was revoked as of Jan. 8. The
Jerusalem Post on Sunday quoted Peretz as saying the hotel has
sinned and was not worthy of the certificate.
   Kosher licenses certify that food in Israeli hotels and
restaurants is prepared according to Jewish law. The licenses are
valuable to firms wishing to attract observant Israelis and Jewish
tourists.
   Gilboa said the Club Hotel, with its 308 double suites
overlooking Lake Kinneret, or the biblical Sea of Galilee, had
special ties with religious tourists.
   ``I don't see a link between kosher and that event,'' Gilboa
said. ``Our kitchen is kosher. We have many Orthodox and religious
guests.''

   A homeless man was arrested Monday in the
strangulation and rape of a pregnant pathologist in her city
hospital office. The suspect sometimes lived at the hospital and
masqueraded as an employee, police said.
   Steven Smith, 23, was found by police at a shelter Monday after
three other homeless men came forward with the doctor's personal
property and said Smith had given it to them, Police Commissioner
Benjamin Ward said.
   Smith was charged with murder, robbery and rape in the death of
Dr. Kathryn Hinnant, 33, Ward said.
   The city had offered a $30,000 reward for information about the
slaying, which Mayor Edward I. Koch called ``the No. 1 case to be
solved.''
   Ms. Hinnant's body was found early Sunday by her husband and a
hospital administrator. The pathologist was five months pregnant and
the medical examiner determined that her death was due to
strangulation.
   Ward said Smith allegedly gave Ms. Hinnant's mink jacket to
another man to sell, Ward said. Police said the doctor was robbed of
a wristwatch, $50 to $75 and the coat.
   Smith told investigators that he and another man named John had
gone to the fourth floor of Bellevue Hospital and attacked Ms.
Hinnant, Ward said. However, the commissioner said, Smith put the
onus of the attack on John, including the rape.
   ``We have not even confirmed that this person lived other than in
the mind of Steven Smith,'' Ward said.
   Investigators also found bloodstained hospital garments in a
garbage container near the Wards Island men's shelter where they
found Smith, Ward said.
   Smith told police that he sometimes lived at Bellevue and had a
bed on the 22nd floor, and would wander through the hospital without
problems while wearing a stethoscope and hospital garb, Ward said.
   Chief of Detectives Robert Colangelo went to the floor, a
maintenance and machinery area, and confirmed that there was a
``lone, dirty bed,'' empty beer cans and a stethoscope, the
commissioner said.
   Ward called it ``a crime of opportunity,'' adding that Smith's
``normal behavior when he is at the hospital is to steal IDs'' and
eat at the hospital cafeteria.
   Ms. Hinnant, who had been working at the hospital on her day off
to prepare a lecture she was to deliver Monday, was remembered
fondly by colleagues.
   Hinnant came in on Saturday ``because she was always looking for
this extra mile and that extra piece of excellence she could give,''
said Dr. John Pearson, director of pathology at the hospital.
   About 50 detectives were assigned to the case, as a debate over
Bellevue security raged.
   ``Security here isn't the tightest. It seems like anyone can walk
in,'' said an intern, Dr. Jane Skorina. But she said the attack was
``an isolated incident and doesn't affect what may happen in the
future.''
   A social worker supervisor, who asked for anonymity, said that
when she once came in on a Saturday she found it ``quite
frightening. I felt quite vulnerable. There are no people around,
even the elevators are lonely.''
   Dr. Jo Ivey Boufford, president of the Health and Hospitals
Corp., said security at the 1,200-bed hospital complex would be
reviewed, but an initial check found nothing out of the ordinary at
the time of the murder.

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Costa Rica announced on Monday the
indefinite postponement of a Central American summit scheduled for
Jan. 15-16 to discuss a regional peace plan.
   ``There definitely will not be a meeting of presidents,'' Foreign
Minister Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto told a news conference in San Jose,
the capital. He said three of the five presidents involved _ the
presidents of Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica _ had agreed to
the suspension.
   The other two countries are Nicaragua and Guatemala.
   ``The new date will be negotiated, adjusting the agendas of the
presidents and of the foreign ministers,'' Madrigal Nieto said.
   He said the summit may take place in February. Foreign ministers
of the five governments will meet in the Nicaraguan capital of
Managua Jan. 17-18, he said.
   Nicaragua said the summit should be held as scheduled rather than
delayed as Costa Rican President Oscar Arias suggested.
   But Foreign Minister Ricardo Acevedo of El Salvador said
President Jose Napoleon Duarte believed it could be held on schedule
only if presidents of all five countries agreed.
   On Friday, Arias suggested postponing the meeting to give
President-elect George Bush time to formulate a Central American
policy. Bush takes office Jan. 20.
   Madrigal Nieto denied that postponement could jeopardize the
Central American peace plan authored by Arias and signed by the five
presidents in Guatemala City in August 1987.
   The plan, which won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for Arias, calls
for greater democracy, an end to civil wars, political amnesties and
an end to the use of one country by rebels fighting in another.
   The pln has been stalled since the presidents last met in January
1988 in Costa Rica.
   ``What we want is not to hold up Esquipulas II, but to so
organize it that it can give better results than achieved so far,''
Madrigal Nieto said.
   He was referring to the name commonly used for the peace plan,
arising from the Guatemalan town where a key, early peace meeting
was held.
   He said the original decision to hold a summit on Jan. 15-16 was
taken ``in a moment of euphoria, as if Central America didn't have
conflicts or obstacles that could intervene in achieving better
results.''
   Madrigal Nieto said committees set up to monitor compliance with
the peace plan would have been unable to overcome differences among
the governments before the original summit date.
   In Managua, President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua telephoned Arias
on Sunday to express ``his concern about the postponement,''
Ortega's press office said Monday.
   Ortega said last week that postponing the meeting ``could mean
the death'' of the Central American peace plan.
   A Costa Rican Foreign Ministry official called Ortega's statement
``out of line.''
   Ortega insisted late Monday that the summit was not postponed. He
said on state-run Nicaraguan radio that any move to delay the
meeting ``will be through a definite decision made by us, all the
Central American presidents.''
   But he added: ``In case the meeting isn't held then, it must be
held as soon as possible.''
   Ortega also said deputy foreign ministers from the five
governments would meet on Tuesday in Managua, the Nicaraguan
capital, to work out a summit agenda.
   Guatemala also has said it opposed delaying the meeting.
   Honduras has not commented. President Jose Azcona Hoyo traveled
to Washington on Monday and will meet Tuesday with President Reagan
and Bush.
   Acevedo said Jan. 29-30 or Feb. 20 were being considered as
alternate dates.
   A technical preparatory meeting should be held as scheduled on
Tuesday and a foreign ministers' meeting could be scheduled for Jan.
17-18, he said.

   Vietnam's foreign minister said Monday he
expects a settlement by September in Cambodia, where Vietnamese
occupying troops have been fighting Cambodian guerrillas for a
decade.
   Nguyen Co Thach said after two hours of talks with Thai Foreign
Minister Siddhi Savetsila: ``Both sides are satisfied.
   ``Both sides have agreed it (the Cambodian problem) will be
solved soon ... by September 1989 within the framework of a
political settlement,'' said Thach, who is also deputy premier.
   Asked whether peace in Cambodia was at hand, Thach told
reporters, ``Peace would be at hand during the first six months of
1989.''
   Siddhi, the highest-ranking Thai official to visit Vietnam since
1976, arrived Monday for a four-day visit. His talks with Thach were
to continue Tuesday.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to oust the Khmer Rouge,
whose brutal four-year rule saw hundreds of thousands of Cambodians
die from executions and famine.
   The Khmer Rouge is the strongest member of a three-party
resistance coalition battling the Soviet-backed Vietnamese. China
and Thailand back the coalition, and the United States supports the
two non-communist groups in it.
   Fears of the Khmer Rouge returning to power have grown as Vietnam
announced a partial withdrawal from Cambodia. Vietnam has said it
will pull out all its troops by the end of this year.
   President Heng Samrin, president of Cambodia's Vietnam-installed
government, said last week that 50,000 Vietnamese troops are in
Cambodia, but Western intelligence officials estimate the number at
about 65,000. Guerrillas say 120,000 Vietnamese troops are in the
country.
   Armed guerrilla strength is estimated at about 47,000.
   Siddhi was also scheduled to hold talks with Vietnam's Communist
Party chief, Nguyen Van Linh, and Premier Do Muoi.
   The Thai foreign minister is paving the way for a trip to Vietnam
by Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan, who has pledged to transform
Indochina from a battlefield into a trading market.
   Last week, the Cambodian government suggested the troops could
withdraw by September if Thailand denies sanctuary to Cambodian
guerrillas and countries halt weapons supplies and other aid to the
resistance.
   Calling Siddhi's trip to Vietnam a ``good sign,'' Vietnam's
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Ho The Lan, told reporters the agenda
was open and that Thach was ``ready to discuss everything.''
   She listed as topics Cambodian peace talks, concerns over the
Khmer Rouge retaking power and the surge of Vietnamese ``boat
people'' refugees into Southeast Asian countries.
   The peace talks would involve Cambodia, the guerrilla groups,
Vietnam, Laos and the six-member Association of Southeast Asian
Nations. Association members are Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia,
Indonesia, the Philippines and Brunei.
   Accompanying Siddhi was a 62-member delegation that included
bankers, investors and businessmen. Its members were to hold talks
with officials of Vietnam's State Commission for Foreign Investment,
the Ministry of External Economic Relations and Vietnam's commercial
bank.
   Thailand is interested in importing oil, wood, minerals and
marine products from Vietnam and developing tourism in the country.

<HEAD>Federal Mediator Halts Talks Between Machinists, Eastern</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts 4 grafs after 3rd graf to UPDATE with union comment,
mediation board declining comment. A version moved on financial wires.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the National Mediation Board halted
talks Monday between troubled Eastern Airlines and its largest union.
   Chairman Walter Wallace returned to Washington and couldn't be
reached immediately for comment, but an Eastern executive said
Wallace gave as his reason the failure of efforts to keep secret the
talks with the Machinists union.
   Wallace arrived Friday for the talks in Key Largo. The sessions
were aimed at ending a contract stalemate that has clouded the
future of the airline, a subsidiary of Houston-based Texas Air Corp.
   Machinists District 100 President Charles E. Bryan accused
Eastern of sabotaging the mediation by releasing statements on the
talks to employees in what he called a violation of a news blackout
on the sessions. He also alleged Eastern failed to bargain in good
faith.
   Bryan called the airline's actions ``unethical, without
principle, deceptive.'' He said the company was ``determined to
force a strike.''
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said Miami television stations
discovered the location of the talks and began covering them Friday.
Matell said the daily employee bulletins, which were obtained by
reporters, were not a violation of the news blackout.
   Bill Gill, assistant executive director of the mediation board,
said he did not know all the reasons behind Wallace's decision and
declined to comment. Harry Bickford, another federal mediator at the
talks, also declined to comment.
   Citing huge losses and high operating costs, Eastern is seeking
major wage cuts from the union. The 8,500 mechanics, baggage
handlers and other ground service workers comprise more than
one-fourth of Eastern's payroll.
   ``The end of talks is certainly a major disappointment with
serious implications about Eastern's future,'' said Joseph B.
Leonard, Eastern's executive vice president and chief operating
officer.
   ``These talks have dragged on for more than 15 months, draining
Eastern's strength with each passing day. We desperately need the
government to provide a process to resolve this dispute within 30
days,'' he said.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said Miami television stations had
discovered the location of the talks and began covering them Friday.
Matell said employee bulletins about the talks that were put out
daily by Eastern, and were obtained by reporters, weren't a
violation of the blackout on information about the talks.
   Charles E. Bryan, president of District 100 of the Machinists
union, declined comment until a news conference, scheduled later
Monday.
   Eastern has been pressing for a federal declaration of an impasse
in the negotiations, which would begin a 30-day cooling-off period.
After that, the union could strike and the company could impose its
own work conditions on the union members.
   The union has claimed that Eastern wants to provoke a strike so
it can try to break it and bust the union.
   Wallace joined mediator Harry Bickford on Friday in an effort to
get the talks moving, but sources speaking on condition of anonymity
said there was virtually no progress.
   The two sides, who last met in intense mediation in July, have
been about $200 million apart. The Machinists were seeking a $50
million raise, while Eastern was seeking $150 million in
concessions, mostly from the non-mechanics represented by the union.
   Eastern reported $233.7 million in losses for the first three
quarters of 1988. Texas Air Corp. also owns non-union Continental
Airlines.

   President Manuel Solis Palma on Monday
led a parade through the capital to mark the 25th anniversary of
student clashes with U.S. military personnel that left 23 dead and
hundreds injured.
   As he led thousands of marchers, including members of his
Cabinet, other government officials, armed civilian militia and
Defense Forces troops, Solis Palma told reporters the demonstration
was ``a message of warning, but not of aggression'' to the United
States.
   On Dec. 9, 1964, thousands of students protesting U.S. ownership
of the Panama Canal mobbed the former canal zone and tried to raise
Panamanian flags over U.S. installations. American troops fired into
the crowd, killing 23 Panamanians.
   Panama temporarily broke diplomatic relations with the United
States over the incident. It prompted negotiations that eventually
led to the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties, under which the United States
is to turn over control of the waterway on Dec. 31, 1999.
   Relations reached a new low last year after two federal grand
juries in the United States indicted Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
Panama's Defense Forces commander and de facto leader, on drug
trafficking and money laundering charges.
   In February, then-President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to fire
Noriega, who instead engineered Delvalle's ouster by the National
Assembly and replaced him with Solis Palma. The United States still
recognizes Delvalle as president
   The Reagan administration imposed diplomatic and economic
sanctions against Panama in a bid to force Noriega to resign.
Noriega denies the drug trafficking charges and alleges the United
States is attempting to abrogate the 1977 canal treaties.
   Demonstrators began their three-mile march Monday at the
Legislative Park, site of the 1964 shootings, and carried banners
that read, ``Unity and Struggle in Defense of the Nation'' and
``Until the Year 2000 with Dignity.'' Civilian militias who were
organized by the Defense Forces last March to repel a possible U.S.
invasion carried rifles, grenade launchers and submachine guns.
   Noriega did not participate in the march.
   Dozens of foreign diplomats attended a commemorative ceremony at
the University of Panama, the national university. Rector Abdiel
Adames condemned the U.S. economic sanctions and declared ``the
lessons derived from such a memorable exploit (the riots) still
apply for the Panamanian nation.''

   Scores of makeshift tents blew in the
chilly wind Monday alongside piles of garbage and donated clothing,
but few homeless Central Americans remained at the crude camp that
moved a federal judge to put an immigration policy on hold.
   Facing eviction from their shantytown, hundreds of aliens who had
set up camp in Brownsville left their tents for shelter in nearby
churches or for other cities.
   The camp had mushroomed in the wake of a Dec. 16 policy change by
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which required the
aliens to stay in south Texas while they applied for political
asylum.
   But the exodus began even before U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela
issued a temporary restraining order Monday against the INS,
allowing the asylum-seekers once again to leave south Texas.
   Many started looking for places to go Sunday after the campsite
property owner posted ``No Trespassing'' signs and the Cameron
County sheriff ordered everyone off the property within 24 hours. On
Monday the deadline was extended another day.
   ``If I just go out there and put them on the street, it's going
to place a bigger burden on everybody,'' said Sheriff Alex Perez.
   But most of the aliens already had found other shelter from
weather that turned cold and rainy. Many stayed in churches.
   As the north wind picked up speed and drizzle continued Monday
afternoon, only a few stragglers remained at the trash-covered lot.
By late Monday, only about 50 campers remained in their lean-to
shelters, and many said they did not plan to stay the night.
   Area residents, however, continued to bring food and clothing.
   ``These are my brothers and sisters in Christ and this is what I
have to do,'' said Mary Mortimore, 68, of Plankinton, S.D., who with
her husband made one of many deliveries of clothing. ``I can't
believe the devastation here.''
   So much clothing was donated that piles of unused shirts, pants,
coats and shoes were scattered over the campsite. Those who left
could not carry it all with them.
   Other people brought hot food.
   ``If we don't feed them, who will?'' asked Fidela Gomez, 55, of
Brownsville, who fed egg and potato tacos and coffee to a long line
of Central Americans Sunday night. ``God doesn't make exceptions
between people. We're all equal in his eyes.''
   ``I'm thankful to the people of Brownsville,'' said Eliseo
Enriquez, 30, a Honduran who spent two weeks in the camp. He and
eight relatives said Monday they were heading for Houston, where
they have family members to help them.
   Life has been difficult in the shantytown.
   Some people lived under sheets of clear plastic held up by tree
limbs, while others stayed in real tents. The most majestic
structure on the site is a 15-by-15-foot house of wood, cardboard
and tar paper, built by 15 Nicaraguans and equipped with separate
rooms for men and women.
   ``You want to buy it?'' asked Vidal Sanchez, 38, a Nicaraguan who
had stayed there, but chose to leave. He was heading for a nearby
Mennonite church, Iglesia Menonita del Cordero, which opened its
auditorium to the immigrants when the cold front hit.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze To Visit Iran, Tehran Radio Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze will visit Iran in the near future, Tehran Radio
reported Monday.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said Shevardnadze confirmed
his visit in a meeting with his Iranian counterpart Ali Akbar
Velayati in Paris, the site of this week's international conference
on chemical weapons.
   ``At this time the ground has been laid for expanding relations
between Tehran and Moscow,'' the Iranian radio quoted Shevardnadze
as saying.
   Ties between the two countries have improved following Iran's
acceptance of a U.N.-mediated cease-fire in the 8-year war with
Iraq, which went into effect Aug. 20.
   The change followed nearly a decade of strain after Iran's 1979
revolution, with Iranian fundamentalist Islamic leaders viewing the
officially athiest Soviet Union with deep suspicion.
   But the Tehran daily Etelaat said in an editorial Monday that the
Soviet Union seems to be turning away from absolute atheism and
authorizing religious practice.
   The editorial, in what could be interpreted as a comparison
between the Soviet Union and the United States, known in Iran as
``the Great Satan,'' said:
   ``Godlessness undisguised is one thing and godlessness under the
guise of religion is quite another ... a hypocritical believer is
worse than a truly godless person.''

   The pilot said there was no need to be
unduly concerned, but some of the passengers only had to look out
their window at a flaming engine to know something was very wrong.
   A short time later, the British Midland Airways Boeing 737 hit
the ground in what one passenger said was a ``shuddering crash ...
like a massive motorcar accident.''
   The plane was less than 15 minutes into a London-Belfast flight
Sunday when Dr. John McCrea looked out of the window and ``saw
flames and flashes coming out of the engine.''
   Minutes later, veteran pilot Kevin Hunt told passengers to
prepare for an emergency landing at East Midlands Airport in central
England. The jet crashed short of the runway.
   McCrea and his wife, Josephine, were returning to their Belfast
home Sunday night from a trip to London.
   ``We had been on the plane for 10 or 12 minutes and they were
serving light meals,'' McCrea said Monday from his bed in Derby
Royal Infirmary, his right arm in a sling.
   ``I felt a shudder and I looked over at the left wing,'' he said,
and the cabin crew stopped the meal service.
   ``The pilot announced that we were not to be unduly concerned,
but I began to wonder what was happening,'' said McCrea, 38. Two
girls started to scream, and ``there were more more flames in the
sky.''
   ``We went on flying for a further five minutes,'' he said. ``The
plane seemed to drop. We lost height.''
   Soon, he could see lights on the highway below.
   ``We carried on two or three minutes and there were more flashes
over the left side of the plane,'' he said. ``The cabin staff were
moving up and down securing all the baggage in the lockers.''
   McCrea read the safety instructions and told his wife to brace
herself. ``I said it could be bumpy. We carried on flying. There
were more flashes and more of what I thought was turbulence.
   ``Not long afterward the captain came on the public address and
told us to prepare for an emergency landing. It seemed like only
five seconds later we were down.''
   Passenger Gareth Jones said women wept after the pilot's warning.
   As the plane started its descent, Jones said he saw sparks fly
from one engine, as he had earlier in the flight. The impact was
like a ``shuddering crash ... It was like a massive motorcar
accident ... crunch ... blackness.''
   Jones, a 38-year-old government employee who suffered bad
bruises, said he held the hand of the distraught woman next to him
during the rapid descent.
   ``The lady next to me ... was obviously very distressed. When the
first engine went she started crying and held my hand. I tried to
joke about how these things could fly on one engine and glide
down,'' he said.
   ``Then the second engine went and she gripped my hand and I said
there was no way we were not getting out of that plane together,''
Jones said. ``I knew if I showed I had any fear she would have been
worse.''
   ``When we hit the ground there was a massive crash _ like a
multiple car accident _ and because we were right next to the
emergency hatch I could see a tree outside and knew we had hit the
ground and must get out,'' Jones later was quoted as saying by The
Times of London newspaper in its Tuesday issue.
   ``I pulled the emergency exit handle and pulled out the lady next
to me. I saw we were standing on the motorway and got to my feet,
but they immediately gave way and I fell down again,'' he said.
   He gave no further details in the interview about what happened
to the woman after they left the plane.
   Nick Stevenson, who suffered a broken leg, said that when the
first engine failed, the plane started losing altitude.
   ``Then the other engine started producing strange noises ... As
we came in on the approach run it started spluttering and then just
stopped and we knew we were going to hit the deck,'' he said.
   McCrea said that when the plane crashed, ``people were moaning
and someone said `My legs hurt.' Another voice said `Please help
me.'''
   He said the man sitting next to him helped pull his wife from the
wreckage.
   ``It seemed only a minute later and someone was crashing the
windows in over the wing ... I think I was the third person off the
plane.''
   Firefighters doused the plane with foam. ``My suit was soaked and
it was slippery underfoot,'' said McCrea.
   Mrs. McCrea, 38, who suffered hip and leg injuries, said she
prayed as the plane fell.
   ``There wasn't time really to panic or worry about it,'' she
said. ``The pilot told us to prepare for a crash-landing _ that's
what we did.''
   Asked if she feared she was going to die, she replied: ``I just
said my prayers and got on with it. There was nothing else to do.''
   At nearby Leicester Royal Infirmary, Alistair McCrory, 43, of
Downpatrick, County Down, said that after his narrow escape he
telephoned his girlfriend, Pat Miles, and proposed marriage.
   ``She has said yes,'' he said.

   A judge on Monday blocked a new
government immigration policy blamed for forcing hundreds of
homeless Central Americans in south Texas to live in primitive camps
and condemned buildings.
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela's temporary restraining order
restores a previous Immigration and Naturalization Service policy
that allows asylum seekers in south Texas to travel to other U.S.
destinations after checking in with the INS.
   Hundreds of the asylum-seekers have camped out in Cameron County,
Texas' southernmost county, since the INS adopted a policy Dec. 16
that all but prevented them from leaving the area while their
applications for political asylum were processed.
   ``One would have to be blind not to recognize that we have a
problem,'' Vela said, in putting the INS policy on hold.
   The temporary restraining order was sought in a lawsuit filed
against the INS on Friday by refugee advocates.
   ``Everybody is euphoric about the good news,'' said Vidal
Sanchez, 38, of Nicaragua, who has lived for more than two weeks in
a primitive camp near Brownsville with more than 300 other Central
Americans awaiting appointments with the INS.
   Sanchez said he planned to leave for Miami by Wednesday.
   He and other campers, many staying under tents fashioned from
tree limbs and discarded sheets of plastic, were told Sunday they
would have to vacate the land after the property owner posted ``No
Trespassing'' signs.
   The campsite's population continued to drop Monday as the
immigrants complied with a sheriff's order to leave or face
trespassing charges. The aliens have been offered shelter in several
nearby churches.
   By late Monday, only about 50 Central Americans were living in
the camp, and many said they did not plan to spend the night.
   The shantytown is across the street from the Catholic
Church-operated Casa Oscar Romero shelter for Central Americans,
which for months has been filled to its court-ordered maximum
occupancy of 200.
   U.S. Rep. Solomon Ortiz, D-Texas, announced Monday that he had
obtained assurances of immediate federal assistance for Cameron
County in providing food and shelter for the influx of Central
Americans.
   Ortiz said he and a team from the Justice Department's community
relations service would tour the county and make recommendations for
immediate action.
   Ortiz said the ideal situation would be to make use of existing
space in federal buildings.
   Vela's temporary restraining order will be in effect until
Thursday, when the judge scheduled a hearing to decide whether to
issue an indefinite preliminary injunction against the new INS
procedure.
   Vern Jervis, an INS spokesman in Washington, said the agency will
contest the restraining order.
   The INS policy, which applies to any district where aliens apply
for asylum, was defended Monday by attorney David Ayala.
   ``Your honor, the immigration service is not to blame for the
plight of the people who are out there,'' Ayala told the judge.
   Jervis said the new procedure was designed to curb abuses of the
asylum process that created backlogs of thousands of cases in some
cities. More than 30,000 asylum-seekers passed through the INS
Harlingen District at the southern tip of Texas last year.
   Most asylum applicants do not qualify for refugee status, Jervis
said, because they are here for economic, not political reasons.
   Under the Dec. 16 policy, INS officials were telling applicants
they could not travel from the area or work while awaiting a
decision on their asylum status, a period of at least 30 days.
   After Vela's order, the victorious immigration attorneys went to
tell the aliens of their changed status.
   ``We're going to advise people that they do not have to live here
in the (Rio Grande) valley in the rain and the cold and vacant lots,
that they can now be with their family, with their friends and they
can pursue their asylum claims in those (destination) cities,'' said
Mark Schneider, an attorney with Proyecto Libertad, a co-counsel to
the lawsuit.
   ``It's marvelous,'' said Maria Isabel Fernandez, 28, of Honduras,
who has camped for two weeks near Casa Romero. ``What else could we
ask for?''
   She and eight relatives said they planned to travel to Houston,
where they have family.
   Sister Juliana Garcia, director of Casa Romero, said many people
at the shelter started preparing to travel as soon as they heard
about the court order.
   ``I think it will alleviate the situation for a lot of people,''
Sister Juliana said. ``People are already making a big line to fix
their papers and leave.''
   The lawsuit against INS Commissioner Alan Nelson and U.S.
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh was filed by Brownsville
immigration attorney Linda Reyna Yanez, Robert Rubin of the San
Francisco Lawyers' Committee for Urban Affairs and the
Harlingen-based Proyecto Libertad immigrant legal advocacy office.
   It accuses the INS of implementing a policy change without
publishing it in the Federal Register for public comment, and of
depriving asylum-seekers of their rights to representation and
access to the asylum process as required by U.S. law under the
Refugee Act of 1980.

<DATELINE>CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reputed cocaine kingpin wanted in
the United States on drug trafficking charges was arrested Monday in
this border town across from El Paso, Texas, officials said.
   Federal judicial police arrested Gilberto Ontiveros Lucero and
held him in a federal jail in Juarez, said Alfonso Sanchez Gallo, a
spokesman with the Chihuahua state government.
   U.S. officials say Ontiveros is responsible for much of the
cocaine that passes into the southwest United States from Mexico.
   Rogelio Abregon Salazar, information director at the newspaper
Diario de Juarez, quoted police officials as saying Ontiveros Lucero
was to be transferred to Mexico City late Monday or Tuesday.
   A spokeswoman with the federal Attorney General's office in
Mexico City said she had no information about the arrest.
   Salazar said Ontiveros was arrested at the home of a friend in
Juarez.
   Ontiveros was arrested on drug charges in Juarez in April 1986.
In May 1988, he was released after a federal judge in Juarez
dismissed all charges against him.
   In June, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration offered a
reward for information leading to Ontiveros' arrest.
   Four men, including the uncle of Ontiveros, were arrested in
August after delivering nearly 20 pounds of cocaine to undercover
police in El Paso.

   Pat Sajak got well wishes from rivals Johnny
Carson and David Letterman on the debut Monday of his CBS late-night
talk show, and he joked that he received a phone call from President
Reagan.
   ``He called to wish me well in the Super Bowl,'' Sajak said in
his opening monologue of ``The Pat Sajak Show.''
   Sajak found himself the opening night recipient of a big kiss
from Morganna, the chesty media-wise kissing bandit who frequents
major sports events to buss and tell.
   He told Morganna, who usually reserves her kisses for sports
stars, ``I'm not a jock, but I do wear one.''
   Sajak said he didn't get much sleep because he had a weird dream
that Time magazine had named Earth as Planet of the Year.
   ``I dreamed the Earth was disqualified because it was the home of
Morton Downey Jr.,'' he said.
   Sajak introduced his bandleader, Tom Scott, and sidekick, Dan
Miller, a former colleague he worked with in Nashville.
   Sajak's desk was before an open window with a set backdrop of the
Los Angeles skyline.
   Sajak asked Miller if he knew what his job was and Miller said
``Yes. It's to move three feet over on the couch each time a new
guest comes out.''
   The first guest, Chevy Chase, turned to Miller and said, ``Ed,
good to see you,'' a reference to Carson sidekick Ed McMahon.
   Other scheduled guests were Joan Van Ark, Michael Gross and the
Judds.
   Earlier, Letterman called Sajak, an occasional guest on his New
York-based show, to offer congratulations and wish him good luck,
Bob Burton, a spokesman for Sajak, said.
   Burton said Sajak had also heard from Carson, but he did not know
if the host of NBC's ``The Tonight Show,'' had called personally.
Regular substitute host Jay Leno was filling in for Carson, who has
bested more than a score of competitors since becoming host of
``Tonight'' in 1962.
   ``Thicke of the Night,'' a syndicated series starring Alan Thicke
in 1983, was ballyhooed as a show that would take Carson down a
notch or two. It lasted less than a year.
   ``The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers'' was a personal rivalry
that inspired bitterness on both sides. Carson said he was offended
that Rivers, who had been permanent substitute host of ``The Tonight
Show,'' had not told him in advance she was leaving to become host
of the Fox Broadcasting Show in 1986. She left the show after about
six months because of poor ratings and the show expired several
months later.
   Sajak's nightly 90-minute show will compete in most cities
against the one-hour ``Tonight Show'' and the first half of ``Late
Night with David Letterman'' on NBC. It's CBS' first talk show since
Merv Griffin left the airwaves in 1972 as another victim of the
rivalry against Carson.
   Sajak, a former TV weatherman best known as host of ``Wheel of
Fortune,'' said he does not see his new show taking on Carson
directly.
   ``We have great respect for Johnny, but we don't plan our show
around him,'' he said in an earlier interview. ``I think CBS has
realistic expectations. They don't think we have to knock somebody
off to be a success. Actually, Johnny's been very gracious to me. He
once asked me to be a guest host.''
   Another late-night talk show that made its debut last week is the
syndicated ``The Arsenio Hall Show.'' Hall became a permanent host
of Fox's ``Late Show'' in 1987 after Rivers was replaced by a series
of rotating hosts. He quit the show to co-star with Eddie Murphy in
the movie ``Coming To America.''

   The trial opened Monday of four left-wing extremists
charged in the slaying of Georges Besse, president of the
state-owned Renault auto company.
   Besse was shot to death outside his Paris apartment on Nov. 17,
1986.
   Nathalie Menigon, 31, and Joelle Aubron 28, of the group Direct
Action, are charged with murder. Jean-Marc Rouillan, 33, and Georges
Cipriani, 38, are charged with complicity.
   The four, surrounded by 10 guards, appeared before a special
seven-judge panel. They refused to stand as the judges entered the
courtroom where Besse's widow and her five children sat with new
Renault chief Raymond Levy.
   They face maximum terms of life in prison if convicted.
   On Feb. 11, 1987, Direct Action claimed responsibility for the
murder in letters sent to news organizations in Paris. The letters
said the killing resulted from a ``world clash between the
international proletariat and the imperialist bourgeoisie.''
   The four were convicted last February of criminal association,
receiving 10-year sentences. Menigon also drew 12 years for the
attempted murder of two policemen in 1983.
   Defense lawyers on Monday complained the four were held in
solitary confinement in special prisons, without opportunity to meet
or discuss a common defense.
   They pleaded their clients were ``victims of an orchestrated
disinformation campaign to neutralize their political
personalities.'' The trial, they said, was ``not only about facts
but what motivated the facts.''
   Direct Action first drew attention in 1979 by bombings such
targets as Interpol, immigration and labor offices and corporate
headquarters.
   In January 1985, it announced a linkup with West Germany's Red
Army Faction to develop a communist guerilla group in Western Europe.
   Meanwhile, Elyette Bess, 57, known as the ``mother'' of Direct
Action, was arrested in Paris Monday, 48 hours after her release on
parole after serving part of a six-year sentence for association
with the accused.
   Bess was convicted July 4. She was picked up again for breaking
regulations restricting her movements.

   Emperor Hirohito's regret over his role in
World War II made him feel unworthy as a father, a former tutor of
his son and successor, Emperor Akihito, said Monday.
   Elizabeth Gray Vining said from her home in suburban Kennett
Square, Pa., the topic came up during one of two hourlong
conversations she had about Akihito's education with the emperor and
Empress Nagako during the four years she taught English to the
prince.
   She said Hirohito at the time saw his son only on weekends and
not necessarily every weekend.
   ``I spoke very frankly,'' said Mrs. Vining, 86, an author of 25
books. ``I said I thought that the crown prince was very devoted to
his father and that he wanted to see his father more often.''
   Hirohito ``then said that he hadn't felt worthy because he hadn't
been able to prevent the war,'' she said.
   Hirohito, 87, died of intestinal cancer Friday without ever
shedding much light on his role during World War II. Historians
generally agree he was a figurehead who was required to approve
decisions of the military leaders, until he decided the Japanese had
suffered enough and personally announced surrender in August 1945.
   Mrs. Vining said she did not know whether Hirohito spent more
time with his son after her conversation with him early in 1949.
   Mrs. Vining, who had worked with the Philadelphia-based Quaker
peace organization, the American Friends Service Committee, became
Akihito's tutor in October 1946 when the crown prince was nearly 13
and continued in that role until December 1950.
   The American Friends Service Committee nominated her for the job,
and several factors led to her selection, she said.
   ``The fact that I was a widow, that I had known sorrow, was
important to the decision,'' she said. ``And the fact that I had
traveled in Europe, and the fact that I was a Quaker and Quakers are
known to stand for peace.'' Her husband had died in an automobile
accident.
   Mrs. Vining has been back to Japan four times since her years as
Akihito's tutor. She saw Akihito and his wife, Michiko, most
recently during the couple's visit last year to the United States.
   ``I think he won't be a copy of his father,'' Mrs. Vining said.
``He'll be his own man. For one thing, he's been in England. He's
met the royal family there.''
   From that experience, he has an understanding of how a
constitutional monarchy works, she said.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot communities met Monday for the second phase of
U.N.-sponsored peace talks aimed at reuniting the Mediterranean
island.
   President George Vassiliou, the Greek Cypriot leader, and Rauf
Denktash, president of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot republic in
Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus, conferred for one hour and 45
minutes.
   A brief U.N. statement gave no details, saying only that the two
agreed to meet again next Monday. The United Nations has proposed a
bizonal federation.
   The seven-week first phase of the talks ended Nov. 7 with little
substantive progress reported. It marked the first direct
negotiations between rival Cypriot leaders in 11 years.
   Cyprus has been divided since Turkey invaded in 1974 and seized
the northern third of the island after an abortive Greek-backed coup
by supporters of union with Greece.
   The 120,000-strong Turkish Cypriot minority declared a separate
state in 1983. Only Turkey recognizes it.
   Denktash demands that power be shared equally between Turkish
Cypriots and the 550,000 Greek Cypriots and rejects demands that
Greek Cypriots be allowed to return north and own property there.
   Vassiliou said at the weekend that his internationally recognized
government has proposed demilitarizing the island and that this
should allay Turkish Cypriot security concerns.

<HEAD>Lawyer Points To Engine Parts He Says Weren't Tested Properly</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Britain-Crash, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Engines on the Boeing 737 that crashed in England,
killing at least 43 people, had parts that were not properly tested,
said a lawyer who sued the engine's maker four months ago.
   But a spokesman for General Electric Co., which manufactures the
engine in a consortium with the French company SNECMA, said engines
on the plane had checked out as normal.
   Attorney Jim Helmer of Cincinnati, in a telephone interview with
The Associated Press, identified the allegedly faulty parts as timer
valves. He said he didn't know if the parts could have caused Sunday
night's crash.
   ``We have verified that the CFM-56 engines did have timer valves
on them that were produced in Seattle, and that the timer valves
were not produced according to specifications,'' Helmer said.
   A GE spokesman in Cincinnati disputed whether there were any
faulty parts that could have caused the crash.
   ``We've gone back and looked at the records of both engines on
the British Midland plane. And the engines, under tests, performed
normally,'' said Dwight Weber.
   ``This included the aircraft flight acceptance tests. At no time
during these tests did any of these engines display any
characteristics that would indicate malfunction of timer assembly,''
he said.
   ``Also, in a malfunction of a timer assembly, the most extreme
result would be an increase of temperature of the engine exhaust gas
temperature of up to 20 degrees centigrade. That's well within the
operating limits of the engines in question,'' Weber said.
   Helmer's suit was filed in September in U.S. District Court in
Cincinnati but was not unsealed until Friday. It alleges violations
of the False Claims Act and was aimed primarily at military
aircraft, Helmer said.
   The suit alleged that General Electric's airplane engine facility
in Seattle failed to properly test parts until sometime in 1987 when
the testimg program was corrected.
   Helmer told The Associated Press the parts were also used in the
type of engine installed in Boeing 737s.
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Jack Gamble declined to
comment on the engine parts.
   The 737-400 model involved in the crash had been delivered to
British Midland Airways 12 weeks ago. It had 500 hours of service.
   Helmer is representing Anthony DiVincenzo, a former plant manger
at General Electric's aircraft division facility in Seattle.
   The False Claims Act allows citizens to sue defense contractors
when contractors receive payments pursuant to falsified standards.
   DiVencenzo maintains through Helmer's suit that General Electric
was required to do certain tests on these parts and that they did
not do the tests or did not do them completely but still certified
they had done the test.
   Helmer said the parts were timer valves. He said he didn't know
what function the parts served but that they were made only at
General Electric's Seattle facility.
   ``We just know they haven't been tested properly,'' Helmer said.

   Two grenades were hurled into a crowd
attending a basketball award ceremony in the southern Philippines,
and the military said Tuesday the toll stood at 13 dead and up to 89
injured.
   Authorities do not know who was responsible for the Sunday night
attack at a basketball court in Esperanza, a town in the Mindanao
island province of Sultan Kudarat about 600 miles south of Manila,
said Lt. Anselmo Cabingan, a military spokesman.
   About 1,000 people, many of them children, were attending the
basketball tournament when the attack took place, said Sgt. Joven
Astrero of the operations section of the Philippine Constabulary in
Cotabato City, about 40 miles west of Esperanza.
   Astrero said the tournament had just ended and the town mayor,
Romulo Latog Sr., was awarding trophies when the blasts occurred.
Latog and his son, Romulo Jr., were among the injured, Astrero said.
   The government-run Philippines News Agency agency said six of the
dead were children under 9 years of age.
   Such attacks are not uncommon in remote, often lawless areas of
the southern Philippines.
   In another development, the military launched a massive search
for Rizal Alih, leader of Moslem policemen who seized a military
camp in Zamboanga City and killed a general, after officers said he
may have escaped a fierce government counterattack Saturday.
   The military launched attacks after the policemen, who took over
the regional headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary last
Thursday, killed Brig. Gen. Eduardo Batalla and his chief of staff,
Col. Romeo Abendan, who were taken hostage.
   ``We cannot at this time confirm or deny that Alih has escaped
and is presently alive,'' military spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo
said.
   At least 21 people were killed during two days of fighting before
the camp was recaptured. Most of the bodies were burned beyond
recognition when rocket-firing helicopters blasted the headquarters
building Saturday.
   Rose Laurente, a major's wife, said Alih held her and eight other
companions hostage briefly, one day after troops recaptured the camp.
   Military spokesman Col. Anthony Elias disputed the woman's
statement, saying she was a relative of Alih.

   A Nigerian graduate student who received
financial aid was identified Monday as the holder of last week's $26
million winning Lotto ticket.
   ``My American dream came true,'' Augustin B. Jombo, the second
largest winner of the Lotto, told a news conference.
   A political science student at Fordham University, Jombo, 37,
received a financial aid check of $7,500 Friday, two days after
winning the New York state lottery.
   ``I'm going to call them and say I don't need it,'' he said,
laughing, telling reporters: ``If you call Fordham, they'll tell you
I owe them.''
   He had wanted to be a professor and do research in international
relations, but said, ``I don't think I want to teach now.''
   He chuckled as he recalled how Nigerian friends told him before
he came to the United States in 1980: ``You are going to have some
experiences that are quite unique.''
   Jombo, who has applied for citizenship, said he bought $12 worth
of tickets at a grocery store moments before the 8 p.m. deadline
last Wednesday.
   Jombo has not seen his wife, Grace, and 16-year-old daughter,
Milia, since 1980 and has never seen their 7-year-old daughter,
Tina. He said he had not called them in Lagos, Nigeria, to tell them
of his win.
   ``I'm going to call them today,'' he said. ``They should come
immediately. They should be with me now. I hope to buy them the good
things in life.''
   He will receive 20 annual payments of more than $1.2 million,
minus the 30 percent federal withholding tax required of
non-resident aliens, or about $866,666. The first check is due in
two weeks.

   Investigators today examined the
wreckage of a nearly new Boeing 737 that crashed along England's
main north-south highway after at least one of its engines caught
fire. The death toll climbed to 41.
   British Midland Airways said sabotage was not suspected in the
crash of its jetliner which, bound for Belfast with 126 people
aboard, attempted an emergency landing Sunday night but plowed into
a highway embankment, spilling bodies and personal belongings.
   Nearly 86 people, many with severe injuries, were taken to
hospitals along with the pilot, 25-year veteran Kevin Hunt. One of
the jet's two engines had caught fire 10 minutes into the flight,
but officials gave no immediate explanation for the second disaster
in British skies in less than three weeks.

   A campaign by Arab states to link nuclear and
chemical disarmament has threatened to jeopardize a consensus at an
international conference called to bolster flagging talks on a
chemical weapons ban.
   At the conference Sunday, the Soviet Union announced it will
start destroying chemical arms stockpiles this year, but U.S.
officials said the Soviets are merely playing ``catch up'' because
the United States has been routinely destroying stockpiles of aging
chemical arms since the early 1980s.
   Delegates from 16 Arab countries at the 150-nation conference
argued, meanwhile, that a total chemical ban would be discriminatory
as long as another weapon of mass destruction exists for a few
countries, Israel among them.

   Entering college freshmen are getting less aid
from the federal government and are increasingly interested in
making their educations pay off in cold cash, according to a survey
of more than 300,000 students.
   The annual survey nonetheless found that students entering
college in 1988 were more likely than their 1987 counterparts to
want to pursue graduate study despite the financial obstacles. And
although students are more interested in making money, they seem
less interested in business careers as a means of reaching that
goal, the survey said.
   The findings released Sunday by the American Council on Education
and the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of
California at Los Angeles are based on questionnaires filled out by
308,007 freshmen entering 585 two-and four-year colleges and
universities. The results were adjusted to reflect the total
population of 1.64 million first-time, full-time entering students
and have a margin of error of plus or minus two points.

   Americans generally agree that homelessness is
widespread and worsening, and most are dissatisfied with the
government's response and would be willing to pay more taxes to
combat the problem, a poll has found.
   A plurality of the 1,084 adults surveyed in the Media
General-Associated Press poll primarily faulted society rather than
the homeless for homelessness. A plurality also said the federal
government is chiefly responsible for solutions.
   The poll exhibited the broad reach of homelessness: Six in 10
said homeless people were in their communities, and three-quarters
said the problem plagues communities of all sizes, not just big
cities.

   A flock of ducks that waddle
through yards and dirty the streets has prompted a neighborhood
civil war of sorts in which both sides are crying foul about the
other's tactics.
   The domesticated Muscovy duck population has swelled to 200,
prompting some to begin efforts to reduce their numbers. The methods
have included egg stealing, trapping, maiming, and ducks being run
down by motorists.
   Those in favor of the ducks claim the animals were in the
Woodland neighborhood when the middle- to upper-class area was
established more than 20 years ago. Opponents say the birds are too
aggressive, leave droppings underfoot and mate in public.

   The Libyan minister mentioned the United States only once by name

   He urged the international community to condemn the incident Jan.
4 over the Mediterranean as a military aggression. The United States

   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela's temporary restraining order
restores a previous Immigration and Naturalization Service policy
that allows asylum seekers in south Texas to travel to other U.S.
destinations after checking in with the INS.
   Hundreds of the asylum-seekers have camped out in Cameron County,
Texas' southernmost county, since the INS adopted a policy Dec. 16
that all but prevented them from leaving the area while their
applications for political asylum were processed.
   ``One would have to be blind not to recognize that we have a

   The recent discovery of a black widow binary _ a
star that destroys its orbiting companion like the spider that eats
its mate _ may provide a missing link in the evolution of the
heavens, astronomers said Monday.
   The object is a rapidly spinning binary pulsar, a dead, collapsed
star that is orbited by a larger, ordinary star.
   Astronomers have discovered that the pulsar is blasting away its
companion in the last phase of an intricate give and take between
the two distant orbs.
   ``The companion is being destroyed,'' said Frederic A. Rasio of
Cornell University. ``It is constantly losing matter. Eventually it
could completely disappear.''
   Astronomers say it appears that the pulsar uses its companion to
build up tremendous spinning speed, then turns on its mate, burning
it up.

<HEAD>Brazilians Will Vote on Monarchy</HEAD>
<UNK>By BRUCE HANDLER ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A provision slipped into the
constitution approved last year requires Brazilians to vote in 1993
on whether to remain a republic or return to the monarchy overthrown
a century ago.
   Who would be king of Latin America's largest and most populous
nation is another question, which the constitution says Congress
would decide. Royalists tend to favor a descendant of Pedro II, the
last king, who was deposed by the military in 1889.
   Their campaign already is afoot.
   ``Monarchy is the cheapest, most modern and most democratic form
of government,'' Rep. Cunha Bueno, author of the constitutional
clause, told about 150 people at the first meeting of the
Constitutional Monarchic Movement.
   ``Monarchy defends the people against their own government. The
most advanced nations in the world have it,'' said Bueno, who is 38
and a five-term congressman of the rightist Social Democratic Party.
   He named Japan, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Britain
and Belgium.
   Applause filled the salon in one of Rio's old, establishment
hotels, a room of chandeliers and crimson drapes with none of the
glitz of tourism.
   Most of those attending were elderly; there were men with canes
dressed in the style of plantation days. A few were young, including
a woman in a striped blouse who had a motorcycle helmet tucked under
an arm.
   Brazil became independent as a monarchy, the only Latin American
nation to do so. It happened in 1822 when the man who became Emperor
Pedro I rebelled against his father, King Joao VI of Portugal.
   After the abdication of Pedro I, his son Pedro II reigned for
nearly 50 years until military officers overthrew him 100 years ago
and proclaimed a republic.
   In an interview, the monarchist Bueno said: ``The so-called
republic was actually a military coup shoved down the people's
throats. Now, finally ... the people will be able to say what kind
of government they want.''
   His constitutional provision calls for free time on radio and
television stations, most of which are privately owned, to get the
message across before the referendum.
   The Monarchic Movement points out that relatively few presidents
have served their full terms in Brazil and repressive military
dictatorships ruled in 1930-1945 and 1964-1985.
   Leaders of the movement credit the monarchy with preventing
Brazil from being broken up into small faction-ridden countries,
their view of the part of Latin America colonized by Spain.
   On the other side are such as Marcello Alencar, Rio's newly
elected mayor, of the socialist-oriented Democratic Labor Party.
   He told an interviewer: ``Monarchism is a joke. Brazil has no
tradition or political structure along those lines. Forget it.''
   Comments like that do not faze Bueno. ``We know we are up against
a lot of prejudice,'' he said, ``but once the people understand what
monarchy is, we will win.''
   Caio Domingues, head of a large advertising agency working with
the pro-monarchy campaign, said: ``Brazil must rethink its form of
government. The one we have now evidently hasn't worked,''
   Domingues cited current annual inflation of more than 1,000
percent and Brazil's $121 billion foreign debt, largest in the Third
World. He wore a golden royal crown pin in his lapel.
   Ovidio da Cunha declared at the monarchy meeting: ``Brazil is
rotten!'' He observed that federal congressmen have raised their own
pay to the equivalent of about $150,000 a year while the minimum
wage set by the government remains at less than $3 a day.
   Da Cunha, 76, is still active as a sociology professor at
Fluminense Federal University in suburban Rio. He said a king would
be like ``a referee in a soccer game, or like a circuit breaker that
shuts off the electricity before the house catches fire.''
   Bueno said most royalists want a descendant of Pedro II as king
of Brazil's 144 million people, who inhabit an area larger than the
48 contiguous United States.
   There's a potential hitch in that, however. Two heirs _ the
emperor's great-grandson Pedro Gastao de Orleans e Braganca and Luiz
Orleans e Braganca, great-grandson of Pedro II's daughter Princess
Isabel, claim to be the true pretender to the throne.
   Pedro Gastao, 75, said he would be willing ``to explain the
advantages of monarchy'' on television. He lives in the former
imperial summer retreat of Petropolis, founded by and named for his
royal ancestor, in the mountains 40 miles north of Rio.
   Domingues, the advertising man, said: ``We are not going to get
involved in names. The situation is very complicated. What we're
interested in is the principle of monarchy.''

<HEAD>Andrew McCarthy Discovers the Heartland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Assoicated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the same year that George Bush and Michael
Dukakis criss-crossed the United States searching for votes, Andrew
McCarthy headed for the heartland.
   ``I had never been to America before _ just New York and L.A.,''
said the actor, who spent extensive time in the Midwest while
filming ``Kansas'' and ``Fresh Horses.''
   Neither film was a box-office hit for McCarthy, who has appeared
in ``St. Elmo's Fire,'' ``Pretty in Pink'' and ``Mannequin,'' but he
enjoyed the chance to work in new environments.
   ``Kansas,'' which also starred Matt Dillon, was filmed in
Lawrence and surrounding areas.
   ``We had a ball,'' McCarthy said in a recent interview. ``I found
the people there really neat. We were big fish in a small pond.''
   In ``Fresh Horses,'' filmed in Cincinnati, McCarthy plays a
college student who breaks up with his fiancee after meeting a poor
country girl (Molly Ringwald).
   ``It was cold,'' he said of the location work. ``There's the
whole starkness up there; it helped the mood of the movie.''
   Nothing could have prepared McCarthy, a theater major at New York
University, for the quickness of his entry into the movie business.
Back in 1983, he was just another student at NYU when he decided to
answer an ``open call'' in the newspaper for a part in ``Class,''
which starred Jacqueline Bisset.
   ``I waited for hours with 500 other kids and they called me
back,'' McCarthy recalled. ``It was so out of the blue. One week I
was in school and the next week I'm in bed with Jacqueline Bisset. I
thought, `I'm doing something right here.' I was going so fast, I
didn't have time to think about it.''
   Bisset gave him a lot of professional help.
   ``She was great, she could have said, `Who is this punk?' and
taken advantage of me. She was amazingly patient and considerate to
me. She and the director would say, `That's the camera, Andrew,'''
he recalled.
   McCarthy's first major success came in 1985 with ``St. Elmo's
Fire,'' which also featured Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez,
Ally Sheedy and Demi Moore.
   ``St. Elmo's Fire,'' a smash hit despite scathing reviews, was a
mixed blessing for McCarthy. He was unquestionably popular at the
box office, but his image suffered from being grouped with other
young actors whose talents were questionable and who were known as
arrogant and pretentious. ``Brat Packers'' they were called.
   ``I never really tried to take it that seriously,'' McCarthy
said. ``I haven't talked to any of them since I worked with them. If
people want labels, it makes it easier to identify someone. I don't
really care. It doesn't mean anything to me.''
   But he was concerned about being cast in parts designed to bring
teen-agers into the theaters.
   ``It's such a trap because they keep sending you the same movies
and then you say I'll do just one more and you're letting them
control your life.''
   So in 1986, McCarthy was happy to have the chance to appear with
Linda Hunt and Linda Bassett in the American Playhouse Production of
``Waiting for the Moon,'' based on the lives of Gertrude Stein and
Alice B. Toklas.
   ``I was doing `Mannequin' when I got the script and I thought it
was a wonderful little story. I also wanted to work with Linda Hunt.
It was a nice little project,'' he said.
   Despite his success, McCarthy is not immune from getting cold
feet _ last- minute doubts about whether he is capable of playing a
particular role. He recalled having those feelings while making
``Weekend at Bernie's,'' a comedy to be released later in 1989.
   ``I was torturing myself, saying `I can't do this. I'm not
funny.' My friend said, `You're such a jerk. You were like this when
you were about to do `Fresh Horses.' You were like this with all of
them.''
   But McCarthy isn't likely to give up this little ritual.
   ``I think it's good for you to ask, `What the hell am I doing
here?' They're paying me a lot of money and I don't know what I'm
doing. That's part of the fun in a sick little way.''
   And if his popularity does fade, McCarthy can always count on the
support of his friends in Middle America.
   ``I got a letter the other day from the Locke family in
Minnesota,'' he said. ``They write me letters every month. They have
a birthday cake for me and I'm invited for Thanksgiving.''

<HEAD>Jerry Jeff Walker Cleans Up His Act</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SEDENO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GRUENE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jerry Jeff Walker walked onto the small
stage at Gruene Hall, slung the exotic reptile skin strap of his
Martin guitar over his shoulder and signaled to the band he was
ready to start.
   To the resounding applause of 600 people at the rustic,
wood-floor honky-tonk, he picked and crooned one country tune after
another, talking to the crowd in between instrumental solos as if he
were talking to old friends.
   At the chorus of one tune, the 46-year-old Walker reminded his
audience he had matured just a bit: He was once regarded as a hard
drinking, cussing rebel both on and off the stage who couldn't care
less for the business end of his career.
   ``We're just here to play a little music, not watch me throw up.
... I've already done that ... before,'' he said to ear-piercing
hoots and hollers in the 110-year-old dance hall where burlap sacks
hung from the rafters and newspaper ads adorned the walls.
   The recent performance was another success. It also was an
inspiration for Walker, who recorded his first album in three years
and his first live one in 10 years at the hall.
   ``I've been playing here for years and we've had fun here,''
Walker said in an interview. ``I usually record live anyway in the
studio and I got some songs that I wanted some people to sing along
on and I wanted to get the audience to join in.
   ``We're living in a very high-tech era with mechanical drums and
other things. I thought it would be fun to make a live album with
just regular ol' musicians playing music.''
   During his two decades in the music business, Walker has played
to thousands at concert halls and to a few fans and friends at dimly
lighted bars in the middle of nowhere.
   Gruene _ pronounced Green _ is about a third of the way to
Austin, where Walker lives with his wife and two children.
   Walker, who recorded the live ``Viva Terlingua'' album in the
once-unknown Hill Country hamlet of Luckenbach, believes Gruene's
small-town flavor was just right for him and his fans for the new
album.
   ``It's more of a treat for people to come here. They can put on
their Levi's, come out in their pickup truck, bring along some beer
and come out and be heard,'' he said.
   The Oneonta, N.Y., native wrote such songs as ``Drifting Way of
Life,'' ``Gypsy Songman,'' ``Hill Country Rain'' and ``Cadillac
Cowboy.''
   But he is best known for ``Mr. Bojangles,'' a song about a
raggedy old man who danced a soft shoe for money. Walker wrote the
tune during his wild days in 1968 but it remains popular and has
been recorded by such artists as Nina Simone.
   ``I still think it's part of everything,'' Walker said. ``I think
people in show business have identified with that song and that's
what's kept it around.''
   Time and a family have changed Walker some, but the rebel is
still within him. He has shed his reputation as a boozer who played
drunk at recordings and concerts. He has an occasional beer or two,
but he spends most of his time writing songs, jogging and playing
golf.
   Gone, too, from Walker's life are the entourages that followed
him around the country. He's a solo act now, but in Austin he knows
he easily can get together a few musicians to play anytime he wants,
as was the case with the live album. But the independent soul within
him refuses to let others dictate how he should write, play or
market his music.
   He's using his own money for the album and it will be released on
his Tried and True label. Susan Walker, 40, his wife of 14 years who
also serves as his business manager and president of an official fan
club, is working out a distribution deal.
   ``I think I've shown other song writers or singers that it's OK
to be a little bit out of what the mainstream is at the time,''
Walker said.
   ``I'm just a happy-go-lucky-kind of a guy that just traveled with
a guitar, played music and never did mind sleeping in the rain,'' he
said, adding that given another chance, he would do it all the same.
   ``I'm a character who lives in the song. I can write about my
life. I can get to sing my memories every night and that's pretty
fortunate. I'm pretty happy with my life. I played the music I
wanted to play and the people that liked it, liked it, and those who
didn't, well, they're probably better off anyway.''
   Though Walker's attitude about fans has at times been perceived
as flippant, he and his wife insist he does care.
   ``I think it's great the fans stayed there and I think my wife,
Susan, getting involved in the business end of my thing has really
helped my fans and me keep in touch with ourselves,'' he said.
   Among those fans is Chris Wall, a 38-year-old Wilsall, Mont.,
singer-songwriter who relocated to Austin to open up shows for
Walker and to be managed by Susan Walker.
   Walker planned to record at least two of Wall's songs on the new
album, including ``Trashy Women,'' and ``I Feel Like Hanks Williams
Tonight.''
   ``I liked Jerry Jeff because of the caliber of songs he was
singing back in the mid-'70s,'' Wall said. ``He was that rebel,
outlaw kind of guy and I think that's what I really liked about him.
   ``He's not what I expected now. He's pretty mellow and we're
pretty good friends. I wonder what he would have been like back then
and I wonder if I would have even been around with him back then.''
   Wall, who hopes Walker can popularize his songs, believes Walker
will be able to revitalize himself with the new album.
   ``This is important to the fans and they all want to be part of
history, just like `Viva Terlingua' in Luckenbach,'' Wall said.
``Not that he needs it or maybe not even want it, but this will
probably put Jerry back where he belongs.''
   For Wall and other struggling artists, Gruene has become a place
for debuts. After Walker's recording, the small community _ with a
bed-and-breakfast, a couple of restaurants and several antique shops
_ may be bustling like Luckenbach did after Walker, Willie Nelson,
Waylon Jennings and others popularized it in music.

<HEAD>Iraq Rewrites History to Rehabilitate Reviled Monarchy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALAH NASRAWI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq is rehabilitating its brief monarchy,
the reviled ``regime of henchmen'' that was begun by the British in
1921 and ended with the murder of the third king in 1958.
   The change of heart became evident after a cease-fire was
declared Aug. 20 in the 8-year-old war with Iran. It has been
accompanied by the first moves toward political liberalization after
decades of iron control.
   Books and articles have appeared reviewing and reassessing the
monarchy created when the Ottoman Empire was carved up after World
War I and Iraq was created from the provinces of Baghdad, Basra and
Mosul.
   Faisal I, third son of Sherif Hussein of Mecca who had lost his
Hashemite kingdom in Syria, was crowned Aug. 23, 1921. The
coronation was arranged by the British, who had occupied what was
then called Mesopotamia since the war.
   Ghazi I and Faisal II, the son and grandson of the first king,
succeeded him. Faisal II was killed in the coup of 1958.
   After 30 years of neglect, the Religious Endowment Ministry has
allocated the equivalent of $3 million to refurbish the royal
cemetery, where the kings and some family members are buried.
   King Hussein of Jordan, a cousin of Faisal II and an important
ally of President Saddam Hussein in the war with Iran, appears to
have been the main influence for rehabilitation.
   When the Jordanian monarch visited Baghdad recently, President
Hussein accompanied him on a visit to the cemetery.
   The ruling Baath Socialist Party attached the ``regime of
henchmen'' label long ago and no one dared defy its version of
history. Now, suddenly, the party allows the same kings to be
portrayed as great nationalists, leaders in the quest for Arab unity.
   ``I'm 100 percent sure that they did not betray their country. .
.. There were only differences of opinion,'' Abdullah Bakr, the last
chief of the royal court, wrote in a magazine article that would
have been impossible before.
   Last month, Saddam Hussein announced a program of political
reform that includes allowing opposition political parties, amnesty
for political prisoners, improvements in human rights and
encouraging private enterprise.
   Western and Arab diplomats question how far he will go toward
reform, but the flood of publications about the monarch emphasizes a
notable decline in censorship.
   The books and articles have spurred debate on whether the time
has come for a reappraisal of Iraq's entire turbulent history _ a
tale of kings, tribal warfare, coups, assassination, Kurdish
rebellion and war encompassed by less than seven decades.
   ``We weren't afraid of them when they were alive, so why should
we fear them when they're dead?'' an Iraqi official said in an
interview, speaking of the discredited kings.
   Fadhil Hussein, a University of Indiana graduate who teaches in
the Baghdad University history department, said it may be too soon
to reassess the monarchy.
   ``You can't prevent historical truth from being marked by
political and social loyalties,'' he told an interviewer. ``History
cannot be written when our recent past still has a great impact on
our present.''
   Nonetheless, books on the subject have sold thousands of copies
and new editions are being printed. Many have been serialized in
newspapers.
   Historians and other academics have differed about the role of
the monarchy in shaping modern Iraq.
   Britain had sought to create a coherent political entity and the
monarchy was a unifying element for a time, but Iraq soon was torn
by tribal rebellion, massacres and political intrigue.
   Iraqis generally have resented the monarchy as the creation of
the British, but many politicians now see the kings as realists who
believed the nation's integrity and development depended on British
protection from external threat.
   Whether they tell the whole truth or not, the publications have
succeeded in bringing history to the attention of younger Iraqis.
   ``There's a huge gap in the new generation's thinking about the
monarchy,'' said Ahmed Fawzi, who has written a dozen books about
his country's short life.
   He described his writings on the monarchy as a ``dignified
revival of history'' for people who are not familiar with the period
and have not received an ``objective account'' from official
teachings in government schools.
   ``The idea is to record the events of this period'' so other
versions ``cannot be easily fabricated,'' he said.

days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On Jan. 20, 1981, Iran released the 52 Americans it had held
hostage for 444 days, minutes after the presidency passed from Jimmy
Carter to Ronald Reagan.
   On this date:
   In 1265, England's Parliament, representing districts, cities and
boroughs, met for the first time.
   In 1801, John Marshall was appointed U.S. chief justice.
   In 1887, the U.S. Senate approved an agreement to lease Pearl
Harbor in Hawaii as a naval base.

VIII.
   In 1937, President Franklin D. Roosevelt became the first chief
executive to be inaugurated on Jan. 20 instead of March 4, because
of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution.

   In 1945, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was sworn into office
for an unprecedented fourth term.
   In 1977, Jimmy Carter was sworn in as the 39th U.S. president,

limousine.
   In 1986, the United States observed the first federal holiday in
honor of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   In 1987, Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite disappeared in Beirut,
Lebanon, while attempting to negotiate the release of Western
hostages.
   Ten years ago: Iranian opposition leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, living in exile in France, issued a statement to his
supporters in Iran, saying, ``I will join you very soon.''
   Five years ago: Johnny Weissmuller, who won five Olympic gold
medals as a swimmer and went on to movie stardom as Tarzan, died in
Acapulco, Mexico, at age 79.
   One year ago: An Arizona House committee opened hearings on the
possible impeachment of Gov. Evan Mecham with testimony that Mecham
once tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat
made against a former top aide.
   Today's birthdays: Comedian George Burns is 93. Movie director
Federico Fellini is 69. Actor DeForest Kelley is 69. Bandleader Ray

<BYLINE>Something To Worry About? ^By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Always and ever there are things to worry about
regarding the economy's future, and no forecaster seeking to remain
employed would dare not mention them.
   To them, the issuance of warnings is professional protection,
allowing a forecast to be made but escaped from if wrong. Nothing is
lost, since most warnings are considered examples of erudition and
responsibility.
   You should, know, however, that most of last year's warnings _
inflation, dollar collapse, stock market debacle, recession _ were
changed in midstream, only to be trotted out again as the New Year
began.
   This is the 1989 list, with comments by Edward Yardeni, the
Prudential_Bache Securities economist who debunked last year's
forecasting myths and stands firm and independent from the general
consensus this year.
   _The Economy Is Overdue For A Recession.
   The expansion has lasted more than six years, a long time by past
measures, suggesting that the odds can't be bucked much longer. But,
hold on; the economic world has changed, and maybe the past isn't
that accurate a criterion.
   True, there has been no general recession in that time period,
but there have been several rolling recessions. Different industries
at different times have been very hard hit, but the impact was
offset by good times in others.
   But what if these different industries slump at the same time? It
could happen, but many U.S. companies now operate globally, and bad
times in the United States could be offset by good business in
Europe.
   _Capacity Is Too Tight.
   The percentage of production capacity rose above 84 percent in
November, marking the highest level in eight years. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, among many, is concerned that such a level
may generate inflation.
   ``This could be a big mistake,'' says Yardeni. Why? Because ``in
an environment of intense global competition, we believe that tight
capacity stimulates expansion rather than big price increases.''
   _The Jobless Rate Is Too Low, So Wage Inflation Will Develop.
   At 5.3 percent of the civilian labor force, the rate is at a
14-year low. There is indeed a shortage of new entrants into the
labor force. The thesis appear sound.
   Still, says Yardeni, ``we believe that the employers recognize
that offering big wage hikes will only drive up their labor costs
rather than attract workers that, demographically speaking, don't
exist.''
   In his opinion, ``odds are that industries will opt to spend more
on labor-saving, productivity to substitute for scarce and expensive
workers.''
   _The Federal Deficit Is Too Large.
   Sure it is large, and that doesn't include perhaps $75 billion to
rescue the thrift industry or maybe $150 billion to clean up
radioactive pollution at the government's weapons plants.
   But there's a brighter side too. The deficit came down from an
annualized peak of $234.4 billion in the second quarter of 1986 to
$124.8 billion in the third quarter of 1988. Include state and local
surpluses and the total government deficit dropped from $174.3
billion to $68.9 billion in this period.
   The big ``problem,'' says Yardeni, is in transfer payments,
designed to redistribute income more equitably, which amounted to
23.2 percent of gross national product in fiscal 1988, a very large
fraction.
   But in terms of expenses for goods and services, the situation
wasn't all that bad. In the third quarter of last year purchases of
goods and services were but 8.1 percent of GNP, compared with more
than 10 percent in the 1960s.
   _The Trade Deficit Isn't Narrowing Fast Enough.
   Really? Says Yardeni: ``The adjustment process is still working
in our view and it will take another two years to produce a zero
trade balance.'' Imports have clearly stopped growing. Exports are
well above previous-year figures.

<HEAD>West Germans Debate Whether to Work on Sunday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public debate about whether they
should work on Sunday is making it hard for citizens of Europe's
richest country to enjoy the sabbath quiet the Bible extols and
their constitution protects.
   Most West Germans hew to the tradition of a day on which the
family has coffee and cake at home and the children often are even
discouraged from going next door to play with friends.
   Popular magazines and newspapers carry contributions from
prominent people singing the virtues of Sunday in church and at home.
   The constitution provides special protection for Sundays as days
``of rest from work and of spiritual uplift,'' but union leaders say
2.2 million in this nation of nearly 62 million people work at least
one Sunday a month.
   Hermann Rappe, head of the 630,000-member chemical workers union,
issued the latest call for more Sunday work. Other union leaders
united against him in what one called an ``avalanche'' of opposition.
   Rappe was quoted as saying in an interview with the newspaper
Osnabruecker Zeitung: ``The unions must be ready to negotiate over
Sunday work for reasons of economics.
   ``I'd prefer to have businesses use their money to create jobs in
the Federal Republic (West Germany) rather than in Spain or Greece.
If that's only possible with more work on weekends, the unions can't
simply say no.''
   Business representatives praised him. Klaus Murmann, head of the
national management council, called Rappe's comments a ``beneficial
shot of realism.''
   Leaders of the printers, public workers, office workers, the
mighty, 2.5-million-member steel workers union and some others
didn't find his viewpoint beneficial in the least.
   ``Hermann Rappe's position was not and is not that of the
printers union,'' spokeswoman Ulla Krause-Schaeuffler told The
Associated Press. ``He has set off an avalanche. We are currently in
negotiations to block Sunday work.''
   Rainer Hillgaertner, spokesman for the public workers, said his
union wants to keep Sunday work to a minimum because ``the cultural
value of having Sunday off ranks above the principle of maximizing
profits.''
   Ernst Breit, head of the DGB labor federation, which has 7.7
million members, also has expressed public opposition to work on
Sunday.
   Church leaders, worried about a drop in attendance, have been
steadfast in disapproval.
   ``We stand by our previous positions,'' Lutheran church spokesman
Peter Kollmar told the AP, citing the importance ``of the observance
of the Lord's Day and the cultural role of Sunday.''
   The issue even united Roman Catholic and Lutheran prelates in
1984 long enough to issue a joint statement denouncing further
expansion of Sunday work.
   ``The Bible teaches us: `God blessed the seventh day and made it
holy, because on that day he ceased from all the work he had set
himself to do,'' the statement said in a citation from Genesis.
   ``Remember to keep the sabbath day holy,'' the Christian leaders
added, quoting from Exodus.

<HEAD>Palestinian Uprising Affects Israeli Artists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONI RABIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The long Palestinian uprising has brought
bitterness to Israeli humor, and the comedian's opener was not meant
to put his audience at ease.
   ``Soldiers in uniform get in with a discount,'' Yonathan Geffen
said, and after a pause: ``Soldiers with clubs get in free.''
   He referred to beatings by soldiers of protesters in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, where more than 300 Palestinians have been
killed and thousands wounded. Such a joke would have been
unthinkable before the rebellion began Dec. 8, 1987.
   In night clubs, theaters and galleries, artists of various kinds
grapple with questions about the violence of occupation and the
brutalizing effect on Israeli society of the army's handling of the
uprising.
   A satire by nightclub performer Dudu Topaz takes the form of an
army radio report of an incident said to have begun when a young
Palestinian urinated on a soldier's leg.
   The army arrests his entire family and destroys their house, and
an officer declares on the radio: ``The youth was known as a
potential terrorist.''
   A reporter finds the perpetrator, but discovers he is not yet old
enough to talk.
   Performing artists have collided with those who control state-run
radio and television. Topaz was barred from a radio talk show for
two weeks for comments critical of the army.
   Israel television rejected a skit by comedian Tuvia Tzafir that
attacked public apathy by depicting an Israeli family watching TV
while a fire raged outside.
   Lyrics in ``Coexistence With Love,'' a new album by vocalist
Astar Shamir, accuse the government of failing to explore options
for peace while young soldiers do the dirty work of occupation.
   As one of her songs, ``A Moment Before the Storm,'' puts it: ``My
brother isn't a cruel soldier, but he's cold in his soul. He stands
there with his hand on the trigger, but he hates the war. ... Don't
send my brother to the trigger.''
   Ms. Shamir said in an interview: ``When I sat opposite the
television last January, and they started showing me what was
happening, I couldn't sleep nights. I know songs don't change things
and can't move armies, but ... they just came pouring out.''
   Early last year, army radio banned pop singer Si Hyman's song
``Shooting and Crying'' about soldiers who used a bulldozer to bury
four young Palestinians alive in a West Bank village. The victims
survived, and the soldiers were given jail terms of up to a year.
   ``Have we forgotten our children were killed, too?'' Hyman asks
in the chorus, alluding to the Nazi extermination of 6 million Jews.
   In a Jaffa nightclub, Tzafir performs a skit accusing Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir of ignoring opportunities for peace.
   It depicts Shamir visiting an eye doctor and refusing to read a
wall chart that says, ``There are Palestinians,'' and in smaller
letters, ``There is a chance for peace.''
   ``My vision is too good,'' Shamir says. ``I need something to
block all this out.''
   Palestinians have incorporated themes of the uprising into songs
and plays. Words of a protest song reflect the tendency toward
rhetoric: ``With the Molotov (gasoline bomb), with the stones, I
make my revolution. ... With the stones, we get rid of the enemy.''
   An art exhibit at the Hakawati Theatre in Arab east Jerusalem was
a series of portraits of Palestinians killed in the rebellion. The
new play ``Waiting for the Savior'' depicts buffoon-like Israeli
soldiers harassing Palestinians going about their daily lives.
   ``Everything is political,'' said Jamal Ghosheh, director of the
theatre. ``We are talking about our lives. Our lives are political.''
   For Israeli performers, who do active and reserve army duty like
everyone else, it is more complicated.
   At one point in his show, Topaz stopped and said, ``I wonder if I
have the right to do this. I'm laughing at everyone, but I'm
laughing at myself as well, because I, too, am a soldier.''
   The comedian, whose father came here from the Soviet Union, said
in an interview: ``This is not the country I wanted. It's not the
kind of behavior I want. If someone had told my father he was coming
to live in a country that would rule another nation, he never would
have come.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The splendid medical technology that saves
countless lives today is also capable of prolonging lives already
lost. It can be a cruel dilemma, but for many terminally ill
patients there's another way: the hospice, an institution of mercy
that has grown by leaps and bounds in the United States. This is the
first of three articles.

   In a fit of depression, when her third
bout with cancer had sounded a death knell, Julia Gebersky inquired
through others whether her son, Robert, had a gun and could shoot.
   Incontinent, her body scarred by bedsores, she had become a
prisoner of her own helplessness. If euthanasia were legal, Bob Gery
said, he would have helped his mother kill herself.
   But there was another way out for Julie Gebersky. Like nearly
200,000 patients a year, she awaited her death in hospice, a way
station for the terminally ill that benignly treats them not for
prolongation of life but to ease their dying and lessen their pain.
   Gery's mother died without much discomfort in the gentle hands of
The Connecticut Hospice, just as his father had died of cancer
nearly 13 years ago under the same hospice care.
   In that span, the number of hospice care programs in the United
States has grown from fewer than 100 to nearly 1,700, according to a
1988 survey by the National Hospice Organization in Arlington, Va.,
which provides technical services for its 900 members.
   While care is much the same, and about 90 percent of it is
provided in the home, the programs are operated by a variety of
organizations. For example, 41.8 percent of the programs are
independently run, 26.6 percent are run by hospitals, 22.4 percent
by agencies that provide care in the home, and 9.2 percent are run
by a coalition of organizations such as nursing homes and hospitals
working together.
   ``Hospice is not a place, it's a program of care,'' says Ira
Bates, vice president of the National Hospice Organization. ``We are
the only health care provider that defines the unit of care as both
the patient and the family.''
   Hospice does this by sending in a team, including volunteers and
social workers, to help the family with housework and personal
problems, to maintain the vigil while they take a break and to help
with funeral arrangements once the patient dies. After that, hospice
workers keep in touch with the family for at least a year to comfort
them.
   Many hospice programs are based in office buildings and lease
beds from hospitals and nursing homes. ``If there is a crisis in the
family, then we can provide continuous home care in the home
around-the-clock,'' Bates says. ``If that's not enough, then we can
move the patient to an inpatient setting.''
   The modern hospice system originated in England in 1967, when
Cicely Saunders, a British physician, founded St. Christopher's
Hospice.
   What brought it about, say hospice authorities, was the leap in
technical advances in medicine since the mid-1950s and the
increasingly common dilemma of terminally ill patients being kept
alive, sometimes against their wishes and the wishes of their
families, at high costs in suffering and financial sacrifice.
   Even some of those dealt the cruelest of hands in life, AIDS
victims who are not only dying but are homeless, find refuge in some
hospices like The Connecticut Hopsice, the first and oldest in the
United States and a leader in care for the terminally ill in the
past two decades.
   Connecticut Hospice began caring for the dying in their homes in
March 1974 and opened a 44-bed hospice for inpatients in July 1980
in Branford. Two years ago, it bought an adjoining home and
converted it into a cottage with five beds for the dying who have no
home or no one to care for them.
   Bates says Connecticut Hospice is unique in its much higher
proportion of inpatient care to home care. It serves as a teaching
hospice as well.
   The average hospice, says Bates, has three or four beds, a paid
staff of eight and 50 volunteers, dealing with about 110 patients a
year. The discharge rate is around 10 percent, those who decide to
seek treatment or who go into remission.
   While hospice patients are mostly elderly cancer victims, as much
as 90 percent, the '80s have brought a new challenge, a younger
generation afflicted with AIDS, either cast aside by society or in
self-imposed exile to keep loved ones from seeing them at their
worst.
   The latest data available from the National Hospice Organization
show hospices served about 2,100 AIDS victims in 1986, among 154,700
patients in all. While later figures are not available, Bates
estimates the number of AIDS victims cared for will reach 6,000 or
7,000.
   Among them are men like Keith Jackson, 27, and Eddie Muniz, 36,
who found accommodations in The Connecticut Hospice cottage last
year, their gaunt bodies implanted with catheters, their shoulders
propped up by hospice volunteers and friends so they could walk,
their lips barely movable, slurring their speech almost as if they'd
suffered a stroke, and coughing, coughing, coughing.
   ``I got a home but I don't want to be near the girls because I've
been sick,'' Muniz, an admitted drug dealer and user and the father
of three daughters, ages 8, 10 and 12, told a visitor last November.
``I know I'm gone. I don't want to go...'' He paused. ``Yet.''
   Jackson, a fashion model who is gay, lived with his divorced
mother until she died two years ago. He said he would rather live in
the cottage than move in with his father or siblings. ``This is my
home,'' he said.
   Nurses, the heart of hospice care, and volunteers, the soul, give
the men medication, feed them, do their laundry and take them out to
dinner and to shop. Like many of the terminally ill, they dread
above all dying alone, in confusion and fear. The hospices quietly
ease those apprehensions.

   For ``sundowners,'' who fear the night and sleep by day, families
are often bedded down by their bedsides in inpatient hospices like
The Connecticut Hospice, which has its own building. Other hospices
operate in a wing or ward of hospitals.
   ``One of the big complaints is that dying is so sterile,'' says
Pat Jones, executive vice president of the Hospice Association of
America, a Washington lobby group that represents 1,300 hospices.
``People were isolated in a hospital room, maybe the family couldn't
come in. I think it's related to the need to be in control of one's
life. I don't think it's an accident that hospice started coming
into being around the same time as home birth. It's taking dying
back into the family, into the home.''
   Indeed, says National Hospice's Bates. ``Most people want to die
at home. Ninety-eight percent will say, `I want to be at home with
my wife and family.' So we make that possible.''
   All of health care, Bates says, is moving toward more choices,
the kind of choices made by Julia Gebersky and by Mark Marcucci, a
57-year-old retired steelworker from Bethel Park, Pa.
   Like others with incurable cancer, they decided they had had
enough of hospitals and doctors and that there was little else
caretakers could do but keep them comfortable.
   Mrs. Gebersky died as she wanted, surrounded by people she loved,
her body free of the dreaded tubes. She had been cared for at her
apartment in neighboring Hamden by a Connecticut Hospice nurse, who
looked in on her twice a week, an outside nurse and a privately
hired, live-in aide who took care of her around-the-clock.
   Mrs. Gebersky fought a cancer in the parotid gland, near the ear,
through surgery and radiation for seven years. Her condition
worsened last fall and at her age, 76, she decided against further
treatment with chemotherapy.
   Her apartment had been decorated for a last Thanksgiving dinner
with her family, and there was a Christmas tree in case there would
be time for that, but two days before the holiday she slipped into a
coma and was moved to The Connecticut Hospice at Branford, where she
died on Thanksgiving Day.
   One of her last wishes was to give the artificial Christmas tree
to the hospice, and Bob Gery, one of her sons, did that.
   Gery's father, Benjamin, 64, died at home of cancer on May 11,
1976, four years before the inpatient hospice was built.
   After his father died, Gery (who shortened his name) served on
the board of Connecticut Hospice for five years, helping raise funds
for the non-profit organization.
   ``You always know where the good service is for this type of
care,'' Gery says. ``The most important thing was that Connecticut
Hospice would respect her wish to die with dignity. That's basically
where hospice distinguished itself from hospitals.''
   Mark Marcucci called it quits after a four-year struggle with
colon cancer. He had been in and out of hospitals, had undergone a
colostomy, catheterization, intravenous morphine to palliate the
pain, had shrunk from 215 pounds to 140 pounds, had begun to
hallucinate.
   When his wife of 26 years, Pat, could no longer care for him at
home, he was admitted last summer to the Forbes Hospice in
Pittsburgh, one of the divisions of the Forbes Health System that
includes hospitals and a gerontology center.
   He stayed at the hospice five days, then came home to die with
his wife and two sons at his side. Death came on Aug. 9, as ``we
kept him comfortable, propped up, and just sat there with him,'' Pat
says. ``It's not that they didn't treat him well at the hospice. I
just think he wanted to be with us.''
   Generally, hospice care is for those who have been diagnosed by a
physician as having six months or less to live. Their average stay
in the program is 45 days.
   In surroundings familiar to them, home-care patients are visited
by a team of hospice workers including nurses, homemakers, social
workers.
   Coincidentally, says Bates, ``any strategy that keeps people out
of hospitals saves loads of money.'' He estimates savings of 20
percent to 40 percent for taxpayers who foot the Medicare bill for
patients 65 and over and for health insurance companies, many of
which now provide hospice benefits.
   Beyond that, says Bates, most hospices are committed to care
regardless of the patient's ability to pay. Since reimbursements
rarely cover expenses, most hospices rely on grants and donations to
meet their budgets. Ninety-five percent of them are non-profit,
Bates says.
   ``Ninety percent of our patients die at home,'' says Patricia
O'Neil, a liaison nurse at the Merrimack Valley Hospice in Andover,
Mass. ``I think that's really important because in order for that to
happen you need a lot of support and intensive visits.''
   Hospice patients range from the very young to the very old. At
Merrimack Valley Hospice, many are in the program only a few days,
because people are naturally reluctant to make the provision, since
it means ``a real acknowledgment that you're finished with looking
for a cure,'' says Mrs. O'Neil.
   ``We can be very low-key,'' she says, ``but there has to be some
understanding, at least from someone in the family, that the
prognosis is limited.''
   Patients, she says, are not necessarily afraid of death itself,
but of the process of dying. A hospice program can comfort them
about that.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The two old brothers lived and worked together on
their remote, hardscrabble farm into their late '70s. They cherished
their cows, practiced frugality, owed no one and kept contentedly
aloof from the turbulent larger world. Then a violent intrusion
upended their lives.

   Mike and Harry Dutchburn shared a life as
predictable as January's blizzards and July's blackberries.
   Awake by 4 and asleep by 9. Off to the barn at 4, 2 and 5.
Errands once a week: St. Albans for parts, Newport for fertilizer,
John Deuso's store at the crossroads for potatoes, hot dogs and
bread.
   In a weather-beaten farmhouse on a lonely stretch of highway 10
miles from Canada, the brothers passed their evenings in unmatched
armchairs in a kitchen papered with sailing ships and maps of the
world.
   The wallpaper was hung by a sister years ago. Mike, 77, and
Harry, 79, likely would have chosen pictures of cows over maps of a
world they've had precious little to do with, until it burst in on
them one January night.
   Anyone in town can point out the Dutchburn place, with its
blistered white paint and drawn shades. Surrounded by open fields,
house and barn sit near the road on a curve that's unexpectedly
tricky. Mike and Harry have lost track of the cars they've pulled
from the mud over the years, a habit of helpfulness that was to cost
them.
   From their kitchen window, they can see their hillside
birthplace, the only other home they've ever known. They still
remember moving day, June 15, 1915, just as they do every journey
away from home ever since: their brother's funeral in Massachusetts
in 1944; Mike's trip to their sister's in Michigan in 1960; the
65-mile drive with their niece, Sandra Lyon, to Burlington a year
and a half ago. Harry hadn't been there for 40 years.
   Except for pies and cookies from Grandma's Bakery in Richford,
the Dutchburns' list of indulgences is shorter than the list of
their trips: an aborted attempt at cigar-smoking in 1940 (Harry),
and two chug-a-lugged bottles of gin in 1939 (Mike).
   ``We don't owe anybody,'' says Mike. ``We pay cash or we do
without. We go right along. That's our way.''
   The Dutchburns' ways _ modesty, hard work and thrift _ were
common knowledge on the frugal little farms of Franklin County. So
was their habit of carrying large sums of cash.
   On the last day of January 1986, the ways of the world _
violence, cruelty and greed _ were brought home to the Dutchburns by
two strangers who called them by name.
   They pretended to be out of gas. The Dutchburns didn't have any,
but Mike climbed out of his narrow iron bed in the middle of the
night. By the time he'd walked the few steps to the kitchen, the two
men had kicked in the door.
   ``You shouldn't be here,'' Mike told them. He got hit in the face.
   Harry, who had $7,000 in his shirt pocket, walked in right behind
him and got hit in the head with the thick maple cane he used to
prod cows.
   Mike put up a fight, but it was over in less than five minutes.
Afterward, Mike says, ``the kitchen looked like you'd cut a bunch of
hens' heads off and let 'em fly.''
   Five minutes was all it took to teach two old men about fear. The
fear never left them, not even after the robbers went to jail.
   ``I don't sleep anymore. I hear the cars all night. You don't
forget it,'' says Mike. He only has to look at his brother to
remember. Harry's right eye hangs like a crooked picture in his
face. It swells and weeps in the cold; since the beating, he no
longer goes out to do chores.
   The cane hanging on its peg is another reminder. So are the dents
it left in the old Kelvinator in the kitchen. ``They could have
taken the money,'' Mike says. ``There's no sense beating a person
up.''
   He rubs the dents gently. ``It's the people in the world that's
changed,'' he says. ``They don't care who they take from.''
   Detective Sgt. Bill Northrup, an 18-year veteran of the Vermont
State Police, calls it ``as brutal as any homicide I've ever
investigated.''
   Except that it wasn't a homicide. The Dutchburns survived.
   They just didn't recover.
   Mike Dutchburn lay for 3{ hours on the kitchen floor after the
beating, afraid to move. Harry was unconscious. When Mike saw a
light go on next door at dawn, he crawled out to his Chevy pickup
and drove half a mile to the neighbor's.
   When their niece got word at 5:30 that morning, she drove
straight to Montgomery. At the farmhouse where she'd spent childhood
vacations petting calves and eating ice cream, Sandy Lyon found two
state police troopers in a kitchen spattered with blood. In her
uncles' hospital room, she says, ``I didn't recognize either one of
them.''
   Lyon, a bank teller with three grown children, has the manners of
a Sunday school teacher _ until she talks about the beating. Then
she starts saying ``hell'' a lot.

   She remembers two strong, handsome men who teased and spoiled her.
   ``They were easygoing. They took you for who you were. Mike
pulled my pigtails. Harry was the perfect image of my dad, who died
when I was 17.''
   Since the beating, she says, ``Harry has been to the barn once.
Mostly, he sits there and broods. They're withdrawn now. They have
that constant fear. Any little noise on the porch and they're
petrified.''
   Harry lets Mike take him to the barber, but outings are rare. He
has trouble climbing into the truck; his back, like his brother's,
is bent from years of work in the low-ceilinged barn.
   The money Harry carried in and out of that barn, the money ripped
out of his pocket, helped lead police to the attackers.
   ``You spend 20 hours a day in a barn,'' Northrup says, ``and your
money will smell like a barn.''
   Salesmen at Champlain Chevrolet in Enosberg knew that smell. It
had lingered long after Mike Dutchburn drove off in his new pickup
truck. They finally tracked it to the cash in the safe.
   Northrup alerted all Vermont banks and stores to be on the
lookout for hundred-dollar bills with ``a strong barn odor.'' That
led to some of the Dutchburns' money. The money led to one of the
men.
   Judge Frank Mahady can still picture the two stooped figures in
faded green work clothes who shuffled into his Burlington courtroom
as if from another century to talk sorrowfully about locking doors
and mistrusting strangers.
   Harry told of no longer being able to work. ``The best part of my
life is gone now,'' he said.
   Mahady listened patiently as the Dutchburns and their niece tried
to explain why two years and eight months in jail _ the terms of a
proposed plea agreement _ didn't feel much like justice.
   ``There is a very fundamental right, the right to be simply left
alone,'' the judge said finally. ``It is so important and so basic
it doesn't have to be set forth in any documents. That basic,
fundamental right was taken away. That's unpardonable.''
   Mahady isn't known for rejecting plea bargains. ``To the hard
right,'' he says wryly, ``I'm known as `the criminal's judge.'''
   He made an exception in the case of Darrell Clark, 39 and
unemployed, with a record of larceny and assault. In July 1987,
Mahady gave Clark five to 10 years in jail. Another judge gave Louis
Gilbeau, 33, a stainer at a furniture factory, eight to 10 years,
with all but five suspended.
   Both men can expect to serve three years and nine months. ``A
rope around the neck would've been better,'' says Harry.
   He and Mike spent three days in the hospital after the beating,
then signed themselves out. The doctors wanted to keep them longer.
The Dutchburns had had enough doctoring.
   They opened a checking account and had telephones installed in
the house and barn. Then they shut themselves up behind new deadbolt
locks.
   The house still looks sealed. Vulnerable and exposed alongside
the highway, it could be abandoned but for the truck in the driveway
and the two figures sitting still as statues in the kitchen.
   They greet prolonged knocking with silence. Eventually, they
respond to introductions shouted through the locked door.
   The gray sky is spitting snow, but inside an ancient stove warms
the kitchen. Harry's gold plaid chair is stationed by the side
window. Mike's green vinyl recliner guards the door. A Holstein and
her calf watch over them from a wall calendar, courtesy of Eastern
Milk Producers.
   A paper bag worn thin as tissue paper holds their memories. One
ghostly snapshot shows two hardy young farmers in matching coveralls
and caps sharing a joke. Side by side, they are broad-shouldered and
handsome, heads tipped back, mouths stretched wide, eyes crinkled
shut.
   Slowly, stiffly, Mike hands the picture to Harry. Out of their
armchairs, both men are curved like question marks, fragile figures
who move gingerly about the kitchen.
   All along the valley in farmhouses much like the Dutchburns',
doors and windows left unlocked for decades were bolted and sealed
that winter, and shotguns put away for next hunting season were
retrieved.
   Franklin County's 37,000 inhabitants had known crime, but mostly
of a different sort: patches of marijuana tucked away in a field, or
burglaries of unoccupied vacation homes owned by out-of-state
skiers. Not the sort of face-to-face crime that has people afraid to
come to the door at night.
   ``There was talk of forming a posse. There was talk of lynching
and tarring and feathering _ an old-fashioned killing party,'' Sandy
recalls.
   ``No hole is deep enough, no rock big enough, to hide scum like
you,'' neighbor James McGroarty wrote in a letter in the Franklin
County Courier. ``I promise you, we'll find you and I pray to God
the police do before I or the other people in our town of Montgomery
do.''
   Eventually, things quieted down. Two men went to jail and life
went back to normal. Except for Mike and Harry.
   This month brings another reminder. A lawsuit they filed against
their assailants goes before a district court jury. ``It's the
principle,'' Sandy says. ``My uncles are never going to be better.
Why should two innocent people have to live this way?''
   The prospect of once again facing their attackers weighs on the
Dutchburns. They try to make light of it. ``We've gotten used to
going to court,'' Harry says, grinning faintly.
   There is no getting used to the locked doors. Or the fear.
   Not long ago, yet another driver missed the curve by the
Dutchburns' and spun off the road into the field. He pounded on
their door for a long time, but Mike and Harry sat very still.
Eventually, he went away.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Mongolia is one of the symbols of remoteness on
earth. Yet this sparsely populated land the size of Western Europe
is 100 percent literate, and inching its way toward modernity. Now
it is taking a leaf from the Soviet Union to speed the process.

   Like its huge and dominant neighbor
to the north, this ancient nation of herdsmen and miners, once ruled
by Genghis Khan, is restructuring its Marxist society.
   But what the Soviets call perestroika, the Mongolians call
``shinechel'' or renewal. And they are greeting the liberation of
the state-controlled economy and the infusion of democracy with an
air of excitement.
   The old ways brought shortages in a land of plenty and political
timidity to a people of great warrior tradition.
   Shinechel is still too new to claim many accomplishments, but
there are great expectations.
   ``Before, we said that capitalism and socialism can't exist
together,'' says Puntagdasyn Luvsandorj, director of the Institute
of Economics of the State Planning Committee. ``Now we say they must
cooperate.''
   The main target of reform is the state monopoly on production
imposed in the 1960s on both industry and, more improbably, in rural
areas where people are scattered across a nation nearly the size of
Western Europe, wandering the grasslands as semi-nomadic herdsmen.
   One consequence is that livestock numbers have stagnated at about
23 million head since the early 1970s even though the human
population has doubled, to about 2 million.
   Half of the meat produced must be exported to the Soviet Union to
pay for Soviet goods and financial aid, leaving city residents to
stand in line, sometimes for hours, for scarce supplies of meat, the
staple of the Mongolian diet.
   More than half the population has left the harsh life on the
grasslands for cities, putting further strains on food supplies.
   ``The food situation is getting worse,'' said one foreign
diplomat, noting that grain and vegetable farms, all run by the
state, are plagued by ``bad planning, bad management and bad
profits.''
   The government is now trying to spur meat production by
increasing the private stocks herdsmen are allowed to keep. Those in
the Gobi desert region can now keep 100 head, while those in other
parts of the country can keep 75. Farmers may now work small private
plots.
   Industry has fared better because of heavy investment and
technical assistance from the Soviet Union and other socialist
nations, helping Mongolia develop its rich mineral resources.
   In December, Mongolia's parliament passed an industrial law
giving factory directors greater authority over planning and
investment. But it's three strikes and you're out. The government
will bail out money-losing enterprises only two times before they
are shut down.
   ``Before, we didn't participate in selling our product, so we
were not interested in quality and meeting world competition,'' said
Chimedeeren Erdenechimeg, general engineer at a carpet factory in
Ulan Bator. ``Now, according to the new law, if we produce a good
product and can find a market, the living conditions of the managers
and workers will improve.''
   Free markets, encouraged by the government, are still small but
growing. Owners of private cars have gone into the taxi service, a
few small restaurants have appeared and private clothesmakers are
selling to retail cooperatives.
   But the pace of economic change is likely to be slow, said one
foreign diplomat. ``It's such a vast country,'' he said, and ``there
is little pressure from below for privatization'' because people are
relatively prosperous and have known nothing but socialism since the
Marxist state was founded in 1921, only four years after the Russian
revolution, making it the second oldest Marxist society in the world.
   Faster change may come in the political sphere, where the ruling
Communist Party is debating an election law that for the first time
will allow direct multi-candidate elections.
   The party is also trying to limit the role of party officials to
policy-making, and streamline the government. ``Marx and Lenin said
the roles of the party, the government and mass organizations should
be separate,'' said Kinayat Zardihan, a leading ideologist in the
party's Institute of Social Sciences. ``But in our country this
difference has disappeared.''
   As in the Soviet Union, the official press is encouraged to
condemn what are now regarded as errors of the past. The press now
speaks openly about repression and political purges in the 1930s.
Yumjaagiyn Tsedenbal, ruler for 40 years until his ouster in 1984,
is knocked for forcing collectivization in the 1960s while his
Russian wife is criticized for wielding too much power.
   Statues in Ulan Bator of Stalin, and other native oppressors,
have recently been smeared with paint.
   Zardihan said the party is now rewriting the nation's history to
include the truth about events that have shaped the nation.
   One government official noted that before now everything that
happened before 1921 was regarded as bad, including the 12th and
13th century advance of Genghis Khan's horsemen that created a
Mongol Empire stretching from the Danube to the coast of China.
   President and party leader Jambyn Batmonh, a 62-year-old former
rector of the state university, is also hoping to ease his remote
and landlocked nation away from its near total dependence on the
Soviet Union and other Soviet bloc nations.
   Relations with China, with which Mongolia shares a 2,900-mile
border, show signs of improvement as Moscow and Beijing patch up old
differences. Mongolia, which sided with the Soviet Union when its
two giant neighbors split in 1960, sent home one division of Soviet
troops in 1987 and has now pledged to remove a ``considerable
number'' of the remaining 50,000 Soviet troops guarding Mongolia
from a potential Chinese attack.
   In early 1987, Mongolia and the United States established
diplomatic relations and are now negotiating cultural and consular
agreements.
   Currently 97 percent of Mongolia's total annual trade of about
$1.6 billion is with socialist countries, 80 percent with the Soviet
Union. Those figures will be hard to change in the near future.
Mongolia receives about a billion dollars in aid and two-thirds of
its capital investment funds from the Soviet Union every year, which
locks it into shipping its ores, cashmere and meat to the socialist
bloc.
   Officially, at least, Mongolians are full of praise for the
Soviet Union, which helped build its cities and industry.
   Under Soviet-style socialism, Mongolia has become a nation of
almost 100 percent literacy where 25 percent receive higher
educations. Medical and other welfare facilities are inexpensive and
worker incomes average nearly 200 dollars a month, one of the higher
figures in Asia.

   At the Young People's Cultural Center
on a Sunday night, Mongolian girls with glitter on their cheeks and
boys wearing narrow ties swivel to the disco beat of American
singers Stevie Wonder and Whitney Houston.
   Upstairs, a 12-piece band belts out Mongolian hits from the 1930s
as a more middle-aged crowd, some dressed in the traditional
robe-like ``del'' and high black riding boots, swirl around the room.
   Despite the isolation _ in the winter the capital of Ulan Bator
is accessible only by plane from Moscow or a 30-hour train ride from
Beijing _ signs of Western influence are seeping into this stolidly
socialist nation of 2 million.
   Foreign visitors must pay hotel and transportation bills with
U.S. dollars and are frequently stopped on the street by
money-changers offering twice the official dollar rate for the
Mongolian currency, the tugrik.
   At the ``dollar store'' in Ulan Bator, Mongolians with American
or other Western money listen to a tape from a San Francisco radio
station program while buying British whiskeys, American toiletries
and Japanese radios.
   English, still rare in a country where studying Russian is
mandatory, is now taught on prime-time national television with a
series arranged through the British Embassy.
   The foreign influence, however, is predominantly Russian.
Thousands of Soviets _ engineers, technical advisers, traders and
soldiers _ live and work in Ulan Bator. The visage of Lenin peers
from statues and billboards around the city, and a war memorial
jutting into the skyline from the top of a hill is dedicated to
Soviet, not Mongolian soldiers.
   Central Ulan Bator _ which means ``Red Hero'' _ is a collection
of Soviet-financed columned government buildings and utilitarian
apartment complexes, most painted in pleasant pastel shades of pink
and yellow. Mongolia must import most of its consumer goods, and 80
percent of its trade is with the Soviet Union.
   Mongolia adopted the Russian Cyrillic script in 1946, and all
schoolchildren must study Russian from the fourth grade on. Study of
the Mongolian script, suppressed for decades, was revived about four
years ago, but classes only begin in the seventh grade.
   Signs in the native script are rare, in contrast to Chinese Inner
Mongolia, where shops and offices frequently carry signs in
Mongolian for the Mongolian minority of 3 million.
   About 6,000 Mongolian university and research students, the
nation's best and brightest, study in the Soviet Union.
   The dependence on Soviet political and cultural reinforcement
goes back to 1921, when Soviet forces helped Mongolia drive out the
Chinese who had occupied the country for more than 200 years and set
up the world's second Communist state.
   Soviet-style socialism was in part Mongolia's salvation, creating
a well-cared-for and well-educated nation. The cost to Mongolian
heritage, however, was high.
   At the turn of the century the Mongolian population was only
500,000 and in danger of being wiped out. Literacy was about 1
percent. Forty percent of the male population lived in the nation's
750 Buddhist lamaseries, one reason for the declining population.
   A Stalinist purge of the 1930s resulted in the closure of all
monasteries and the murder of many monks. Today the Gandan Monastery
in Ulan Bator, with 160 monks, is the only functioning Buddhist
temple in the country.
   In the 1940s, the Mongolian script was suppressed and in the
1950s there was a campaign to ban wearing of the native costume.
   Plans to celebrate the 800th birthday of the great Mongol warrior
Genghis Khan in 1962 were scaled down as a result of Soviet
displeasure.
   Mongolian culture persists in both the ``del,'' the usual form of
dress in the countryside, and the ``ger,'' or ``yurt,'' the round,
canvas-colored tent which is still home to about half Ulan Bator's
500,000 people.
   In the countryside, semi-nomadic herding remains the main way of
life despite collectivization of their herds of sheep, horses, cows
and camels.
   ``We need more settled animal husbandry to supply cities with
meat and milk,'' says O. Shagdarsuren, rector of the Mongolian State
University.
   But Shagdarsuren, who grew up in a herdsman's family, said
Mongolia should keep its nomadic ways. ``In settled husbandry people
live for the animals. In nomadic husbandry, the animals are always
working for man.''
   Mongolia is also working to ensure that its human population,
which occupies only a tiny part of this Western Europe-sized nation
of steppes, deserts, forestland and mountains, will continue to grow.
   A mother giving birth to her fourth child receives a 15-day
vacation at a state rest house and is eligible for retirement at 50.
Further births means greater salary and pension benefits, and a
woman with eight children is awarded a ``first class medal of famous
mothers.''

<DATELINE>KARAKORUM, Mongolia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chultem Tumurbaatap is a socialist
nomad, a herdsman who wanders for the state across the endless
steppes of Mongolia.
   Tumurbaatap, 26, rides herd on 400 horses assigned to him by the
Karakorum State Farm, near the ruins of the ancient capital from
where the sons of Genghis Khan once conquered an empire stretching
from Eastern Europe to the Pacific.
   Like his ancestors, he sets off every spring with his animals for
a half-year of seeking the green pastures of mountain hideaways,
returning for a more settled life during the long and harsh
Mongolian winters.
   But in socialist Mongolia, the young horseman receives a salary
for his labors, and other benefits such as paid vacations. The state
farm to which he belongs, of medium size, has 1,000 members and
100,000 head of sheep, horses, cows and camels.
   Tumurbaatap, hosting visitors in the round, canvas-covered tent,
or ``yurt,'' that is still common in both rural and urban Mongolia,
shyly brushed off suggestions that socialism might not be suited for
the wild and isolated life of a nomadic herdsman.
   He said he is paid $150 a month and his wife receives a similar
amount for helping with the milking of the horses. He receives
bonuses for keeping the herd healthy and holding down losses from
wolves and winter winds.
   With the money, he has bought a generator-operated
black-and-white television, a radio, a saddle with silver buckles, a
new $1,600 yurt and a motorcycle. He said that in about 10 years he
might have enough to buy a car.
   Farm workers drive to his winter campsite about 9 miles outside
the dirt-road town once a week with portable hot-water showers.
Movies, stores and performing troupes also make the rounds of the
grasslands and the farm provides a vehicle to help transport his
yurt when he is on the move.
   His three infants, when they are ready for school, will receive
free boarding at the farm's school dormitory.
   Turmubaatap, who trains horses for racing, said he did wish the
state would let him keep more private animals. Now he is allowed to
own only 10 head and a few of the foals born every year.
   Socialist amenities have not softened the herdsman. ``I like the
snows in winter,'' he answers laconically when asked about life on
the steppes when the temperatures dip to minus-22 degrees Farenheit.
   Like other herdsmen, he wears a fur hat, high-pointed boots and
the ``del,'' the traditional long silk robe tied at the waist with
an orange sash and with sheepskin lining in the winter. His
24-year-old wife, Bavuu Sanjaasuren, wears a similar outfit but
sports nail polish and a fashionable white-striped knit hat.
   ``Horses don't like Western clothes,'' he said when asked why he
prefers the native costume.
   During the winter, the family eats mainly horsemeat, boiled on a
dung-heated iron stove in the middle of the yurt. The family,
including the children, keep warm by drinking ``airak,'' a mildly
alcoholic drink made from fermented mare's milk.
   Tumurbaatap was stationed in the capital of Ulan Bator during a
three-year stint in the army, but says he's not attracted to city
life. ``I want to live in the countryside,'' he said. ``I like
horses.''

   Iowa farmer and hunter Norbert Bremer
traveled 10,000 miles and spent $10,000 to get a shot at a ram on
the frozen, wind-lashed wasteland of the Gobi desert.
   ``I had a wonderful time,'' says Bremer, showing off the mighty
curved horns of a Gobi ram, his trophy from one of the world's more
exotic safaris.
   He is one of some 350 hunters (out of 600 who apply) whom the
Mongolians allowed in last year. They control the number to preserve
the wildlife.
   Bremer, 52, also tracked down a tall-horned Siberian ibex as part
of the tour, and, for an extra $750, shot a blacktailed gazelle.
   He was the last hunter of 1988 to take the Gobi tour. He said
temperatures in the Mongolian desert plunged to zero, and the wind
knifed through the treeless scrub at 30 mph.
   Bremer, who farms 880 acres of corn and soybeans in Ocheyedan,
Iowa, says he read of the Gobi hunt in hunting magazines. For about
$6,500 the Mongolian tourist agency, Zhuulchin, provided in-country
transportation, guides and attendants, and a license to shoot one
Gobi sheep and one ibex.
   Bremer had to get here on his own, via Beijing.
   He also paid a fee of $200 dollars for every inch of the ram's
horn in excess of 43{ inches.
   His kill had horns of 51 inches, which Bremer said may make the
record books.
   But the experience was more than the hunt. His party passed
nomadic herdsmen, some armed with rifles and riding camels and
horses as they tended their herds and flocks in the parched bush.
   The hunters lived in a yurt, the round tent-like home of
Mongolian herdsmen, and were served by an interpreter, a driver, a
cook, a camp manager and a young woman who tended the stoves and
skinned the animals.
   The tourist agency also offers safaris to the woodlands of
central and northeast Mongolia, where elk, moose, deer and brown
bear abound.
   G. Batsukh, deputy general director of Zhuulchin, said several
years ago the government sold licenses to hunt the rare and
beautiful snow leopard found in the Altai range, claiming the
leopard population had increased and was preying on cattle, yaks and
people. But he said only one or two of the white and black leopards
were killed, and shooting licenses are no longer issued.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's a cat-and-mouse game in the skies,
specially-equipped planes of the U.S. Customs Service in search of
suspected drug smugglers. They sometimes fly long hours to no avail,
patrolling the Gulf of Mexico and the U.S.-Mexican border from Texas
to California. But when the quarry is sighted, there is often the
thrill of an airborne chase which one radar operator compares to
``an act of war.''

   Flying wingtip-to-wingtip with
suspected smugglers or buzzing a boat to get a better look, the air
crews of the U.S. Customs Service are on the front line in the war
on drugs.
   Equipped with high-tech radar that can spot a plane 200 miles
away, they roam the skies at 20,000 feet or skim the waters of the
Gulf of Mexico.
   They know the thrill of an airborne chase.
   ``It seems like what we're doing is an act of war,'' says radar
detection specialist Steve MacDonald as he scans the skies on his
radar screen.
   Using five four-engine P3 Orions the size of airliners and two
smaller twin-engine E2C Hawkeyes, the Customs Service runs its
surveillance detection operations here at the Corpus Christi Naval
Air Station on the Gulf of Mexico.
   These crews have a tough job. They are responsible for patrolling
the vast Gulf and the U.S.-Mexican border from Texas to California.
Their equipment often fails. They get little help from countries
south of the border.
   The system of tethered radar balloons that will someday relieve
much of their border coverage is behind schedule _ only four of a
planned 17 are operating.
   But they are excited about their new $20 million P3 outfitted by
its builder, Lockheed, with an airborne early warning (AEW) radar
dome on top _ similar to that of an Air Force Airborne Warning and
Control plan (AWACS).
   On this plane, radar operators sit at two computer keyboards,
where they can track planes 200 miles away, assign color codes to
friendly and suspect aircraft, and direct Customs planes on a chase.
A second dome plane is due in April and Customs hopes for a total of
four.
   Stanley Adams, a Customs pilot and surveillance branch
supervisor, likened current detection coverage to hiding a pea in a
shell game. ``You keep moving the coverage around'' hoping to hit
the right place on the right night.
   This is not first-class flying. This is flying with erratic
temperature controls that can leave you sweating, or can keep a soda
ice cold without a refrigerator.
   This is flying on a roller coaster, because during a chase, the
pilots have little time to find ``windows'' through rough weather.
   This is flying in the three-seat radar compartment of an E2C,
which is so narrow that a quarter turn of a chair is all the room
you have. It is so noisy on the plane built for aircraft carriers
that special earplugs are required.
   Compared to the Hawkeye, the P3 is a luxury, with a refrigerator
and a microwave oven.
   On a recent winter's night, the P3 is patrolling over the Gulf of
Mexico when a call from a Customs intelligence agent in Houston
sends the crew on a 200-mile chase.
   The pilots gun the four prop-jet engines and the airspeed
indicator jumps from 240 knots to 360 knots.
   As the plane bumps through the clouds, two radar operators search
for their target on their screens.
   ``Did they say his lights were off?'' one crew member asks
another on the radio.
   ``No self-respecting smuggler would keep his lights on,'' one of
the pilots responds.
   The thrill of the chase, as happens too often, evaporates when
the P3 arrives in the target area. The suspect cannot be found,
perhaps because he had already landed at a remote airstrip.
   Sometimes, though, the Customs fliers strike pay dirt.
   ``A couple of weeks ago we chased a plane that landed on Cat
Island in the Bahamas,'' says radar operator Buck Benham. ``The drug
plane had dumped its load at the airport. We saw cars headed for the
airport to pick up the drugs. We sent in a helicopter. They rounded
up the plane and pilot. We kept circling 150 feet off the ground
trying to identify the vehicles, and the smugglers were running
every which way.''

<TEXT>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas: which way.''    When looking for boats, Customs
planes fly right over the top of vessels and then circle them to get an
identification.    ``I wonder what they think down there,'' says one crew
member as the four-engine plane buzzes a fishing boat.    As the plane
skims the Gulf waters, the pilots have on their laps a list of suspicious
boats provided by Customs' intelligence officers.    A fishing boat is
spotted heading for the Alacran Reef about 80 miles from the Yucatan Peninsula
of Mexico. The reef has a sheltered lagoon and sheds, where Customs believes
drugs are stored.    The plane circles several times, and bingo _ one
of the boats on the intelligence list is spotted. The Coast Guard is notified
and will send a cutter to see whether there are drugs aboard.    Customs'
chances of spotting suspicious planes increase dramatically when the P3
radar dome plane is flying.    Radar operator Edward Smith locks onto
a target by simply touching the monitor. He sees the target's position,
course, speed and altitude.    As planes appear on the screen as little
squares, Smith color-codes his displays: green for friendly planes, yellow
for unknown aircraft and red for hostile.    Smugglers often try to evade
detection by flying in an unusual air corridor at slow speed and low altitude
with no lights, small tail numbers or with their numbers painted over.
There is no transponder signal.    If the radar plane wants another Customs
aircraft to tail a suspect, the computer is programmed to give the chase
plane the right heading and speed.    The computer screen displays the
angle needed for convergence, and keeps changing the speed, course and
altitude the Customs plane must maintain. There are two computer screens
and each can handle three intercepts simultaneously.    Little crosses
on the screen automatically plot a smuggler's course, something that once
was computed manually by an operator.    In the future, Customs command
centers thousands of miles away will be able to transmit their radar
pictures to the flying platform and have the P3 direct a chase.    When
the AEW is flying, the four other P3s serve as long-range tracking planes
that can keep a suspect on their radar for hundreds of miles.    But over
the United States, the P3 will often call in a shorter-range tracker, possibly
a jet interceptor, and a Blackhawk helicopter carrying a team of officers
who can land quickly and make arrests.    The job is not without danger.
   Adams notes that the domed aircraft can be spotted from apartments
that line the bay outside the base. ``People can sit there with binoculars
and can tell what time we're leaving.    ``We don't tell the tower where
we're going. We're maneuvering all the time. We control the planning, go
on short notice and keep communications secure.''    Smith suspects that
air traffic controllers in Mexico ``can monitor our search patterns and
tip off smugglers.''    ``Look in the bay,'' he says. ``There are 30 or
40 shrimpers working at night. All you need is a high frequency radio to
call bases in Mexico. We give fake return to base calls to flush these
guys out.''    Adams says politicians and publicity also often hinder
their effort.    During a special mission off Colombia last summer, when
P3s were based on the island of Curacao, the local island newspaper published
a story about the intense effort to detect airborne smugglers leaving Colombia.
   During the recent Operation Alliance, a huge anti-drug operation along
the Southwest border, politicians lined up to announce the latest major
effort in the war on drugs.    With such highly public operations as Alliance,
Adams says, ``We might as well go home.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ A psychologist at the University of California
spent 10 years studying 60 families split by divorce and found some
unexpected patterns. Now Judith Wallerstein is publishing her
findings in a book to be published next month. It seeks to answer
the question, ``Who wins, who loses, and why?''
</TEXT>
<NOTE>By JOHN BARBOUR</NOTE>
<NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Every year, more than 2 million Americans in some degree of
desperation seek a ``second chance'' in life through divorce.
   But a new look at this phenomenon finds that things are not
necessarily better the second time around and the chances of success
are more elusive than was thought.
   And society often forgets to think much about the 1 million or so
children a year who are involved in divorce, most of whom sense a
loss of protection and fear of the future.
   Furthermore, the study shows, the aftershocks of divorce echo
through the personal lives of all concerned at least a decade later.
   Judith Wallerstein, a psychologist at the University of
California and founder of the Center for the Family in Transition,
has studied in depth 60 families for more than 10 years.
   Her findings are to be published next month in a book, ``Second
Chances _Men, Women and Children a Decade After Divorce,'' written
in collaboration with science writer Sandra Blakeslee. The sub-sub
title is even more provocative: ``Who Wins, Who Loses _ And Why.''
   Among the findings that Wallerstein discovered as ``new,
scientific and unexpected,'' was ``that in most instances one person
was much better off.''
   ``One person is very important in life,'' she says. ``But the
other member was, on balance, either in the same place or not doing
too well. You're looking at a much greater divergence after divorce,
and that's entirely new.''
   Who gets the major benefit of ``the second chance'' boils down to
who wanted the divorce, whether male or female.
   Wallerstein says she is not against divorce. ``Divorce is much
more than the coup de grace of a stressful marriage,'' she writes.
``It is a new beginning that offers people second chances. It is no
more and no less than an opportunity to rebuild lives. And there's
the rub.''
   The book tells of the pitfalls, the expectations, the denial, and
the quiet dramas through the voices of those involved, and
Wallerstein has obviously won the trust and the understanding of
these people with whom she has been involved these many years.
   ``In the book there are three major families we built on,'' she
says. ``I think those people started off equal... We ask, `Why did
you get married?' Almost all of them tell us they married for love.
They thought they were equal. They weren't shotgun marriages because
someone got pregnant, although some of them were. By and large they
knew each other...
   ``In some of the marriages that we see, there never was a
marriage, however one defines marriages in terms of love, intimacy,
friendship. There was unhappiness, loneliness or violence _ whatever
_ from the start.
   ``But in a whole group of these marriages, there was at some
point a real marriage, and then it didn't endure for a whole lot of
different reasons.''
   In fact, Wallerstein says, ``We're almost at the point in America
where we are beginning to know more about divorce than we know about
marriage.''
   She is tempted next to write about what it is that makes
marriages break up.
   In investigating the aftermath of divorce she found that each
participant has a different view, even the children, although they
are almost unanimous in thinking that the divorce was a good thing
for their parents.
   Not so for the children. ``You're in a mine field of moral
issues, because the children feel they are worse off,'' Wallerstein
says. ``I'm not sure they were, but they feel they were, and that's
an important distinction. I think in many ways they were better
off.''
   Nor is it a passing thing: ``Again this was a finding I didn't
expect. I was startled when I first looked at it. It crescendoes as
they move into young adulthood, as they are looking at an important
love affair, an important commitment. That's when they really worry:
Am I going to be locked into what happened to my Mom and Dad.''
   The children envy their friends who have two parents, Wallerstein
says. They have an idealized sense of a two-parent family. They feel
those other children are better protected. But they worry on behalf
of themselves and their future children about the possibility of
betrayal.
   There is a lot of premarital living together, yet these children
of divorce are basically conservative, not believing in open
marriage, against what they see as cheating, in search of a
long-term commitment.
   ``Now this is what they want,'' Wallerstein says. ``What they do
is often at odds with what they want.''
   Young women tend to get involved with a lot of young men,
apparently unafraid of getting hurt, Wallerstein says. ``It's a
complex picture we're looking at.''
   Ironically, when they are most in need of outside support, the
process is crippled. One parent or another may simply abdicate, just
when co-parenting is most important. That, in fact, is one of the
prime remedies that Wallerstein would like to see set in place by
the divorce process.
   A lot of the children she studied, frequently the children of
upper-middle class professionals, never get to college because child
support ends at 18.
   ``It's not fair,'' she says. ``In these families very few fathers
helped their children after age 18. They didn't all plead poverty.
It was a sense that they had done all that they were legally
obligated to do... I was surpised. I was very distressed. It wasn't
that they weren't seeing their children, but often there was a sort
of blunting that had occurred.''
   Wallerstein would like to call this phenomenon to the attention
of society. Divorce is in many cases necessary and the best thing
for everyone concerned. But the sequelae need to be addressed.
   ``We saw as much anger between the parents 10 years later as
there was at the outset. It was not a cheerful finding. The
co-parenting was disrupted, the relationships between fathers and
children were disrupted, although a major finding was that at
adolescence there was a rising need for the father.
   ``The divorce can become a remedy, a very important remedy for
one parent. But what's not recognized is how hard it can be for the
children, and that is something that can be changed.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Membership in college fraternities has almost
doubled in the past 10 years, and unlike in their golden years of
the 1950s there is little supervision or strict rules. But that may
be changing. A series of scandals involving hazing in the past
couple of years has tarnished the image of the brotherhoods and
stirred an outcry for reforms.

   The 14 newly pinned college fraternity
pledges, roused by the members' speeches and their own desire to
belong, were led downstairs into the darkened Lambda Chi Alpha
basement and lined up in front of the bar.
   On went the lights, revealing the final stage of the pinning
night. There sat 200 ``kamikazes,'' a potent vodka concoction.
   They drank.
   James Callahan of North Bergen drank until he dropped dead.
   The 18-year-old's alcohol death last winter at Rutgers University
was one of a string of scandals at fraternity houses around the
country that have brought more pressure for reforms of the
Greek-letter brotherhoods.
   With their futures at stake, fraternities are responding.
   Bars in many fraternity houses are being closed and advisers are
returning. And the National Interfraternity Conference is
considering a total ban on pledging.
   ``It's not easy to change the culture, but until we do I think
there are going to be very bad days ahead for fraternities,'' says
John Creedon, a Rutgers assistant provost. Since Callahan's death,
Creedon has led the push for fraternity reforms at Rutgers.
   ``Fraternities are under fire as never before,'' says Eileen
Stevens, a national anti-hazing activist. Mrs. Stevens has traveled
the country since her son died 10 years ago after drinking too much
during a hazing at Alfred University in upstate New York.
   ``Their very future is in jeopardy,'' Mrs. Stevens says. ``I
think we've come to a point where the people who supervise them
realize the problems are enormous, and they're just not sure what to
do about it.''
   The problems boil down to two hard-dying traditions _ drinking
and hazing.
   Critics call fraternities an anachronism.
   ``Fraternities have been engaged, like the brontosaurus, in a
futile struggle against a changed climate,'' Earl Smith, dean at
Colby College, wrote last year in the Chronicle of Higher Education.
Fraternities have been banned at Colby since 1984, when
administrators decided they no longer fit in at the college in
Waterville, Maine.
   Fraternity leaders say the scandals are relatively few, that
elitism charges are unfounded and that the positives such as
friendship, leadership development and community service far
outweigh any negatives.
   But over the past two years, defenders of the fraternity system
have winced at a series of incidents. In addition to the Rutgers
death:
   _our members of the University of Alabama chapter of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, the largest national fraternity, were arrested on charges
of selling cocaine. They were accused of making some of the drug
deals out of the stately chapter house.
   _At the University of Lowell in Massachusetts, six fraternity
members were charged under the state's tough anti-hazing law over a
stunt that sent a pledge to the hospital with a body temperature of
109. The members had bundled the victim in a sleeping bag and turned
on heaters nearby.
   _A former University of Delaware student claimed in a lawsuit
that someone dumped caustic oven cleaner over his head during a
fraternity ``Hell Night.''
   But nothing stirred an outcry like Callahan's death at Rutgers.
It inspired nearly a dozen bills in the New Jersey Legislature and
is cited by fraternity critics nationally.
   ``That probably had more impact on us than any other hazing
incident,'' says Jonathan Brant, director of the National
Interfraternity Conference.
   The reprisals against Lambda Chi Alpha were swift and harsh. The
Rutgers chapter was disbanded and the house doors slammed shut.
   The 29 other fraternities were ordered to pull out their basement
bars, which had become standard equipment at Rutgers fraternities,
and make other reforms.
   It could have been worse.

   In recent years, more than a dozen colleges have banned
Greek-letter organizations. Besides Colby, fraternities are passe at
Amherst College and the University of Lowell, both in Massachusetts,
and Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa.
   At the Pennsylvania college, ``the trustees felt the fraternities
had been reduced in many ways to underage drinking clubs,'' says
college spokeswoman Patti Lawson.
   The mounting pressure against fraternities threatens what has
been a steadily rising membership.
   Undergraduate fraternity membership has climbed to 400,000,
according to the interfraternity conference. That's more than double
the 1970 figures and a 170,000 increase since 1980.
   Unlike the Greek system's golden age of the 1950s, this heyday
has come in a relatively unsupervised environment, campus
administrators note. Gone are the housemothers, strict rules and
other formalities that once characterized fraternity life.
   But some college administrations are starting to reintroduce the
supervision. It's met with resistance from many fraternity chapters,
but some are starting to respond.
   Resident advisers have moved into chapter houses on the
University of Southern California's fraternity row. Fraternities
have gone completely dry at Indiana University, home to one of the
strongest Greek systems in the country.
   The fraternities' national magazines abound with denunciations of
alcohol abuse, sexism and racism.
   A recent edition of Alpha Tau Omega's publication chronicles that
fraternity's efforts to halt a national liquor promotion geared to
male college students.
   The governing body of Zeta Beta Tau voted in September to end
pledging, an idea being studied by the national Greek council.
   Callahan's death came a few days after more than 40 Princeton
students were treated for alcohol poisoning following a drinking
binge at two private social clubs.
   Fifteen Lambda Chi Alpha members were charged with aggravated
hazing in Callahan's death. They have yet to come to trial, but a
conviction would carry a maximum penalty of 18 months in jail and a
$7,500 fine.
   ``I've had calls from all across the country,'' says James
Meisel, a Hackensack lawyer who is representing Callahan's mother.
``Among the people I've talked to _ university people, crusader
groups _ there's a consensus that as a general matter drinking is
way out of hand on college campuses.''
   Joseph Discenza, a lawyer for Lambda Chi's board of trustees,
acknowledges there was ``peer pressure'' for the pledges to drink.
But Discenza contends that nobody was forced.
   He says Callahan's own reckless behavior was to blame for his
death, which an autopsy attributed to 23 ounces of alcohol and a
.434 percent blood alcohol content _ more than four times the legal
limit.
   ``This one isolated incident says nothing,'' says Discenza, an
alumnus of the Rutgers Lambda Chi Alpha chapter. ``It says if
someone really wants to drink a lot they can. It could have happened
just as easily in my basement.''
   Michael Steinbruck, a Delta Phi member, is leading a fight
against the Rutgers administration's latest proposal for reform _ a
requirement that each chapter have an adult, live-in adviser.
   Steinbruck, 23, has a scrapbook full of press clippings about his
chapter's work raising money for New Brunswick homeless shelters and
other causes. He believes the university has ignored the good works
of fraternities and acted in a reactionary fashion to Callahan's
death.
   ``People are so fed up with constantly being on the defensive
about hazing, they're willing to try lots of different plans if they
feel they have a reasonable chance of succeeding,'' says Patrick
Brown, president of the national fraternity council.
   The goal, Brown says, is to reinforce the founding purposes of
friendship and scholarship and eliminate ``the basic
irresponsibility, whether it is alcohol abuse, hazing, poor
scholarship...
   ``Fraternity can be a magnificent educational movement if it's
appropriately directed. I'm convinced we're taking it in the
direction it has to go if we're to survive.''

   David Sanborn, probably the world's only
professional alto saxophone player hosting a TV variety show, says
that even the sponsors seem surprised at the favorable ratings.
   Since October, Sanborn has been co-host of ``Sunday Night,'' a
weekly late-night musical variety show on NBC affiliates. His
co-host is Jools Holland, keyboardist in the English pop band
Squeeze, who once hosted an English TV musical variety show, ``The
Tube.''
   ``The ratings have been pretty good,'' Sanborn says. ``I think it
surprised everybody, the sponsors included. It's not exactly a
wonderful time slot, 12:30 Sunday nights.''
   Sanborn, 43, had his first band and cut the first of his dozen
recordings in 1975. He played with the Chicago-style Paul
Butterfield Blues Band for four years starting in 1967. He also
toured with Stevie Wonder, Gil Evans, the Rolling Stones, David
Bowie, James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt, Rickie Lee Jones, the Brecker
Brothers and others.
   He's been a semi-regular with the band on ``Late Night with David
Letterman.''
   The idea for the variety show, he says, ``was presented to me as
a situation where guest musicians would sit in with a house band and
it would be a pretty eclectic mix of musicians. That appealed to me.
   ``I thought it would be worthwhile doing, to show people who
ordinarily wouldn't get to be on commercial TV, like Eddie Palmieri,
David `Fathead' Newman, Betty Wright, Al Green, Marianne Faithfull,
NRBQ, Sonny Rollins, Slim Gaillard. If we can do something of high
quality on TV and people like it, we've accomplished something.''
   Working on ``Sunday Night,'' plus compiling a weekly radio jazz
show, has left Sanborn with no time to tour.
   ``I've been fairly successful,'' he says. I've been able to make
a living and I'm very grateful for it. I didn't become a musician to
make a lot of money.''
   On ``Sunday Night,'' Sanborn plays the saxophone every week.
   He says, ``On an ideal show, we get somebody contemporary and an
artist who has been around a longer time. Ivan Neville is a young
singer and Ruth Brown has been around since the 1950s. That would be
a model show.
   ``We'd like to get Robert Cray with Albert King, Eric Clapton
with Etta James, Bonnie Raitt with Koko Taylor. A great idea would
be Tammy Wynette and Elvis Costello. That's a tough one.''
   The biggest problem with ``Sunday Night'' so far, Sanborn says,
has been finding musicians whose touring schedules permit them to
appear.
   Another problem is the lack of time for talk. ``It's
infuriating,'' Sanford says. ``You have 30 seconds to do an in-depth
interview with a musician. There's no way you can avoid sounding
superficial.''
   Sanborn's ``The Jazz Show'' is syndicated, for the third season,
to about 150 radio stations by Westwood One Radio Network.
   Eating brown rice and millet during an interview in his small
Manhattan apartment, Sanborn, who is divorced, says, ``I try to live
pretty healthy, given the schedule that I have.
   ``In an ordinary week, we rehearse Monday and Tuesday for TV,
tape Wednesday, rehearse Thursday and Friday, tape another show
Saturday and do the radio show on Sunday. I don't know if I have the
stamina to keep the radio show going.''
   He tours with a band in the summertime. ``In 1988, I was in
Europe, Japan, Hong Kong and had a few dates on the West Coast,'' he
says. ``This summer I'll tour in the States. I'll play a lot of
indoor-outdoor pavilions and 2,000 to 5,000-seat theaters. Most of
my audience is concentrated in the big cities.''
   On his most recent album, ``Close-Up,'' on Reprise, Sanborn does
some jazz-style improvising. ``But I think the rhythmic orientation,
which is to me what defines the idiom, is more rhythm 'n' blues than
jazz,'' he says.
   His biggest selling album was ``A Change of Heart,'' out in 1987.
``After I do something, I kind of dump the information about it. I
remember that because it did so well. My last four or five albums
have sold around half a million. That one sold about 650,000.''
   Sanborn also practices every day, as he has been doing since he
started playing saxophone at age 11 in St. Louis. ``David Newman and
Hank Crawford were my idols back then,'' he says. ``They were in Ray
Charles' band. I had their records and heard them live.
   ``I had David Newman on `Sunday Night.' It was a real thrill.''

   When Nancy Dussault first saw ``Into the Woods,''
the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical that opened on Broadway
more than a year ago, she thought, ``Gee, I could do that.''
   She could _ and eventually did.
   In December, the buoyant musical comedy performer joined the cast
of the fairy tale musical as the Witch, a role originally played by
Bernadette Peters.
   For Dussault, the show is something of a homecoming, a roundabout
return to the Broadway theater after several long side trips, mostly
to television where she co-hosted ``Good Morning America'' and
appeared in the series ``Too Close for Comfort.''
   Not that she was completely away from performing on the stage. In
fact, when Dussault got the call for ``Into the Woods,'' she was in
Michigan starring in a production of ``Follies,'' another Sondheim
musical. The actress didn't hesitate to come to New York for her
first Broadway show in 10 years.
   ``You don't get that many chances on Broadway anymore,'' she
says. ``Today, it's real hard. There's no place for kids to work.
When they tell me, `I'm going into the musical theater,' my heart
stops.''
   Dussault had no such problems when she began her own career which
started in the mid-1950s with a high school production of
``Brigadoon.'' The little girl with the big voice later attended
Northwestern University as a music major and worked at a tent
theater in Highland Park, Ill., where one summer she did 12 shows.
   ``We were so young,'' she recalls. ``What did we care how hard we
worked. But we had real training.''
   Every day meant four hours of singing drills, then stage
exercises, improvisations, learning how to work so close to an
audience, and then lectures on grooming, makeup and weight
maintenance.
   ``I got a great education in the etiquette of theater,'' Dussault
says. ``It was so valuable.''
   That education came in handy when she made her way to New York
and first made her name in small revues created by Julius Monk at
the famous Upstairs at the Downstairs.
   ``I loved doing revues, two shows a night at $100 a week,'' she
says. ``When I look at `Saturday Night Live' I'm sorry I was just a
little too old when it started. You want someone who does all the
accents and the insanities and sings, even upside down? Whatever you
want, I can do it.''
   Her big Broadway break came in 1960 when she played the ingenue
in ``Do Re Mi,'' a musical that starred Phil Silvers. She won a
Theater World award and was nominated for a Tony.
   After that, she never stopped working in the theater, at least
while Broadway kept doing big musicals. But big shows became fewer
and fewer.
   ``I really thought I would always be able to make my living in
the theater,'' Dussault says. ``And I did for a long, long time.''
   Eventually she realized that to be hired for the theater, you had
to have a name, and making a name meant California and television.
   ``I had to go do that, and it made me desperately unhappy,''
Dussault says. ``I just wanted to sing and dance. I grew up with
those kinds of movies. And I didn't understand the impact of
television. As it turned out, I like doing television a lot,
especially the quickness of it.''
   She plunged into TV, guest-starring on scores of television
shows. Today, audiences remember her best as the original co-host on
``Good Morning America'' and as Ted Knight's wife on ``Too Close for
Comfort'' for much of the 1980s. That job provided steady
employment, lasting six years.
   ``People criticized our show as a silly little sitcom,'' she
recalls. ``But I said, `No, we worked real hard, and we tried to
make it good.'''
   In between, there were short tours or limited engagements each
year in shows like ``I'm Getting My Act Together and Taking It on
the Road'' or the Michigan engagement of ``Follies.'' But you can't
play the ingenue forever, and those roles were for older women.
   ``I'm very aware of how long I've been in the business and what
my age is,'' she says. ``I'm not a child anymore. I know the roles
are changing for me. And I try not to be frightened by it.''
   That's why she jumped at the chance to play the Witch in ``Into
the Woods.'' Besides Peters, such diverse actresses and singers as
Phylicia Rashad of ``The Cosby Show'' and Cleo Laine have tackled it.
   ``I kind of like coming into a show that's already running rather
than go through all the rigamarole of getting a new musical on,''
Dussault says.
   Besides, the role gave her a chance to work with Sondheim, who
wrote the music and lyrics for ``Into the Woods.''
   ``He is our guiding light,'' she says. ``I don't quite know how
to articulate it. I guess I think he's a genius. He has such passion
for his job, and he works at it so hard.
   ``And he fortunately has gotten into a position when people will
always pay attention to what he is doing _ and rightly so. He's
unique.''
   Sondheim went over the music with Dussault, explaining the
rhythms and the orchestrations, particularly how they work to convey
emotions.
   What happens when her ``Into the Woods'' contract is up in six
months?
   ``I've been threatening for years to do a one-woman show,''
Dussault says. ``My biggest problem is trying to decide what that
would be. Whether it should be a conglomeration of songs or have a
theme. Either way, it's a lovely way to continue working in the
theater.''

<HEAD>Montserrat: Emerald Isle of the Caribbean</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PLYMOUTH, Montserrat (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This island of 12,000 people has been
British since 1783, but a carved wooden shamrock perches on the
colonial governor's roof and an immigration officer will stamp the
Irish symbol in your passport.
   Montserrat, a pear-shaped haven of densely forested mountains,
palm trees, multicolored flowers and gray-black volcanic beaches
between Antigua and Guadeloupe, is a hint of Ireland in the
Caribbean.
   Tourist brochures call it the Emerald Isle, St. Patrick's Day is
a legal holiday and a version of Irish stew is a local delicacy.
   Although the population is 98 percent black and the climate
semitropical, you can flip through the telephone book and imagine
yourself in Killarney. Row after row of Ryans, Rileys and O'Garros.
   Both the head of government and his main rival are named Osborne:
Chief Minister John and opposition leader Bertrand, a distant cousin.
   Driving around Montserrat, a hilly 11 miles long and seven wide,
you pass St. Patrick's, Cork Hill, Sweeney's Estate, Carr's Bay,
Bransby Point and Galway's Soufriere, a volcanic crater of bubbling
sulfur.
   In the north, you find the most Irish Montserratians of all, the
so-called black Irish, who make up 10 percent of the population and
are as likely as not to speak with a hint of brogue and have a tinge
of red in the hair.
   Most other Montserratians are descendants of slaves who took
their masters' names after emancipation in 1832, when Irish people
greatly outnumbered English on the island.
   Anthropologist John Messenger of Ohio State University said the
black Irish descend directly from legal marriages in the 17th
century between African slaves and Irish plantation owners, and
Irish customs were passed down through the centuries.
   ``They are very close-knit and inbred,'' he said, and three
family names predominate: Gibbons, Sweeney and Allen.
   Among them, Messenger found Montserrat's last known Irish fiddler
a few years ago. ``He held the fiddle in the crook of his arm and
his daughter did an Irish stepdance,'' the anthropologist said.
   Messenger and his wife Betty, a fellow anthropologist at Ohio
State, have been digging at Montserrat's Irish roots since 1965.
They were making their 20th or so visit over the Christmas-New Year
school break and talked about their work.
   Christopher Columbus sighted the island in 1493 and named it for
the serrated mountains and abbey of Montserrat in Spain. The English
settled Montserrat in the early 1600s, and gained undisputed control
in 1783 after a series of wars with the French.
   John Messenger said there is historical evidence the Irish
arrived in two separate groups in the same year, 1632, and settled
on different parts of the island. One contingent came from nearby
St. Kitts and the other from Jamestown in Virginia Colony, both to
escape Protestant persecution, he said.
   Before long, the Irish outnumbered the English on Montserrat.
   They established many of the sugar, lime and tobacco plantations
worked by imported slaves. A census record in 1678 gave the
population as 52 Scots, 761 English, 992 slaves and 1,869 Irish.
   Irish people settled throughout the Caribbean but became
concentrated here.
   Messenger said there was little awareness of the the island's
Irish past until he and his wife wrote several articles for the
Irish Times of Dublin in 1967 and lectured in Ireland.
   Since then, two films on the black Irish have been shown in
Europe and the Irish and Irish-Americans have become interested.
   ``We got the ball rolling,'' the anthropologist said.
   He said the Montserrat tourist industry has promoted the Irish
connection in hopes of attracting Irish-Americans, an estimated
1,500 to 2,000 of whom visited last year.
   Most islanders don't seem all that interested, however. Howard
Fergus, a faculty member at the University of the West Indies and
Montserrat's leading historian, suggested Irishness is not something
they would to boast about.
   ``I don't think there is any attachment to the Irish,'' he said.
``People celebrate St. Patrick's Day here, but apart from the church
connection a number of us celebrate it because on that day there was
a slave rebellion,'' on March 17, 1768.
   About his own name being Irish, Fergus said: ``Yes, but it
doesn't mean anything to me. It merely is a slave name. ... The
Irish are white people.''

<HEAD>AIDS Fear Leads To Clotting Factor Shortage For Hemophiliacs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Perhaps the best thing that ever happened to 20,000
Americans with the bleeding disease hemophilia was the discovery of
treatment with a protein called factor VIII. It was also probably
the worst.
   Five-minute infusions of this natural substance overcome their
bodies' inability to form blood clots so they can lead nearly normal
lives. But the price has been disastrously high: The treatments also
have given more than half of them AIDS infections.
   The treatment has been made safe again, but another crisis looms.
Factor VIII is in severe, sometimes life-threateningly short supply.
   ``In the New York region, we've used 30 to 40 percent less
clotting factor'' in 1988, said Dr. Richard Lipton of Long Island
Jewish Medical Center. ``I don't know if I can say anyone has died
because of this, but we have had some pretty hairy situations trying
to find factor VIII for people who are bleeding.''
   Doctors say that because of the shortage, most non-emergency
surgery has been postponed for hemophiliacs. Bleeding often is
treated with less than the recommended doses, sometimes with poor
results. Users have smaller reserves for emergencies. Most have
stopped taking preventive doses and now use clotting factor only for
actual bleeding.
   They also have had to rely more on cryoprecipitate, an older,
less convenient therapy that requires a trip to the hospital to
receive blood plasma that is rich in factor VIII. This treatment
carries the same very slight risk of AIDS as an ordinary blood
transfusion.
   The shortage ``has produced a tremendous amount of frustration,
and in some people despair, in some anger and in some resignation,''
said Donald S. Goldman, a lawyer from West Orange, N.J., who has
hemophilia.
   Hemophiliacs represent just 1 percent of the 80,000 AIDS cases
reported in the United States since 1982. However, a larger
proportion of them are infected than are the other two major risk
groups, homosexual men and drug addicts.
   About 60 percent of U.S. hemophiliacs are infected, and for those
with the most severe form of the disease it's perhaps 80 percent to
90 percent, said Alan Brownstein, executive director of the National
Hemophilia Foundation.
   While most of the hemophiliacs who carry the AIDS virus are still
healthy, doctors fear that many of them will eventually get AIDS.
   Hemophilia is caused by a genetic defect passed from mothers to
sons at conception. Victims don't produce enough factor VIII, one
link in the chemical chain reaction that prompts the body to stop
bleeding. Without treatment, cuts may bleed for days, but the most
common problem is bleeding internally. Bleeding into the joints
causes crippling deformities.
   Once, the only treatment for hemophilia was blood transfusions.
Then blood plasma was substituted. In the 1960s, cryoprecipitate
became the standard. Finally, in the 1970s, factor VIII became
available. Instead of 30 to 50 trips a year to a hospital for
infusions, people with severe cases could quickly treat themselves
at work or at home.
   ``We are talking about people who, aside from the horrible AIDS
tragedy, have been liberated by clotting factor,'' said Brownstein.
``A person with hemophilia can do any job now. If they have a
spontaneous bleeding episode, they can mix their preparations and
infuse themselves on the spot. They can do it as conveniently in a
747 as in their own living room.''
   Factor VIII is derived from human blood. It takes about 30 liters
to produce enough clotting factor for one treatment. In commercial
production, blood plasma from many people is mixed together. A
single dose may contain elements of blood from 20,000 people or more.
   No one knew it at the time, but during late 1970s and early
1980s, AIDS virus in the donated blood passed through the
purification process into the factor VIII. In 1982, the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control reported the first three suspected cases of AIDS
among hemophiliacs.
   In 1984, manufacturers began heating the clotting factor in an
effort to kill HIV, the AIDS virus, and a year later, a test became
available to screen donated blood for the virus. Since then, factor
VIII makers have adopted other cleansing techniques, including
detergents and antibodies.
   Since 1985, only 18 new AIDS infections have been documented,
said Brownstein, who believes the latest strategies have made
clotting factor HIV-free. But they have also made it expensive and
scarce. The new processes yield only about half as much factor VIII
per liter as the earlier techniques.
   Robert W. Reilly, president of the American Blood Resources
Association, an industry group, said the price has risen six- to
seven-fold since 1985. Enough clotting factor for one person now
typically costs about $50,000 a year, Brownstein said.
   The price and supply were also affected by low demand for
albumin. Until recently, factor VIII was simply a by-product of the
business of producing albumin, which was used to restore blood
volume after surgery and burns. However, albumin is being replaced
by newer treatments.
   Factor VII was already in short supply at the start of 1988. But
the situation became much worse because of problems at the American
Red Cross, which produces about 20 percent of the country's clotting
factor.
   Last April, the Red Cross discovered it had allowed factor VIII
to be made from blood that should have been discarded because of
potential AIDS contamination. Dr. S. Gerald Sandler, vice president
for blood services, said that most of this was from people whose
blood twice tested positive for HIV during initial screening but was
shown by later confirmatory tests to be safe.
   These donations were thrown out, but the donors were later
allowed to give blood again. This time their blood passed the
initial screening test. However, because of their earlier positive
results, acceptance of the blood was a violation of Food and Drug
Administration rules.
   Since then, the Red Cross has released little factor VIII,
although it recently resumed production. Meanwhile, about 7 percent
of the nation's usual annual production is on hold. Officials of the
Red Cross and FDA believe it is safe. But because of errors in the
way it was produced, FDA officials say they would be breaking their
rules if they allowed its release.
   Paul Parkman, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics
Evaluation and Research, said the FDA might allow the questionable
factor to be released as an experimental drug. Users would have to
sign consent statements acknowledging that they understood the
protein did not meet federal standards.
   Brownstein said that last year, 675 million units of factor VIII
were available in the United States, and 591 million were used. In
1988, about 450 million units were available, and virtually all of
it was used.
   Reilly said the major commercial makers expect to improve
production during 1989, and with the Red Cross back in business, the
shortage should begin to ease during the second half of 1989.

<HEAD>Solar Cooker Promoted As Benefit To Third World Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA WILKINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A simple box of cardboard, foil and glass is
being promoted as a means to free Third World women from the
time-consuming search for firewood and get them out of the unhealthy
smoke of wood cookfires.
   The solar cookers, designed by two Arizona women, are being
introduced in the Third World by Pillsbury Co. ``We feel the
potential of solar cookers is so great that it could truly alleviate
some of the global problems,'' said William H. Sperber, a senior
research microbiologist at the food conglomerate.
   The United Nations estimates 1.5 billion people are affected by
firewood shortages, said Robert Metcalf, a microbiologist at
California State University-Sacramento who attended graduate school
with Sperber at the University of Wisconsin 20 years ago and is
working with Pillsbury.
   ``They've got a lot of sunshine, but they don't know how to use
it,'' Metcalf said. ``It's fun in the United States, it can be very
useful, but it's critical in developing countries.''
   The cooker is an insulated box within a box topped with a glass
pane and a reflector that directs sunlight. It can be made out of
cardboard or wood, and aluminum foil. Food is cooked in dark,
covered metal, glass or ceramic pots.
   The temperature peaks at 250-275 degrees, meaning food takes
longer to cook than in electric ovens. But Metcalf says users save
time by no longer having to collect firewood and by not having to
stir the food because of the low heat.
   Metcalf, who has been promoting the solar cooker since 1979, was
joined by Pillsbury in 1986. He and Sperber have demonstrated it in
Africa and South and Central America. Pillsbury is spending more
than $100,000 on the program.
   Simplicity may be an obstacle to widespread adoption, supporters
say.
   ``It doesn't look as high tech as other things that have been
tried,'' said Chris Flavin, vice president of research at Worldwatch
Institute, a private non-profit research group that focuses on
global resource issues.
   ``There's an actual bias in development agencies against anything
that's small and decentralized,'' said Flavin. ``They like to
support big projects because they're easy to manage.''
   Flawed cookers produced before the Arizona women designed theirs
also have discouraged widespread use. They tipped easily,
temporarily blinded users, had reflectors that fell off and were
able to cook only one pot of food at a time.
   Barbara Kerr of Taylor, Ariz., a nurse, and Sherry Cole of Tempe,
a former free-lance writer and neighbor of Kerr's, created the
design in the mid-1970s. Since then, Cole said, they've sold about
3,000 kits and cookers ranging from $40 to $275 and several thousand
plans, from $1 to $3.75.
   Sperber and Pillsbury became involved in 1986 while working in
Bolivia with the Freedom from Hunger Foundation, a private,
nonprofit group, on the problems of lack of firewood, high infant
mortality and diarrhea. Metcalf and scientists from Pillsbury's
Technology Center have worked to simplify the design so it can be
better mass produced and more easily assembled in the field.
   By trial and error, Metcalf and his family have developed recipes
that work with the cooker. Vegetables, which contain moisture, don't
need to be cooked in water, they discovered after one ``soggy
mess.'' Chicken can be cooked in three hours but can't be overcooked
because the low temperature won't turn moisture in the food to
steam, dry out the food and burn it. The normal amount of water is
added to dried grains, such as rice, and to beans.
   ``They're cooking their corn and beans today in Guatemala ... in
these types of cookers and really taking control of their lives,''
he said. ``This is what I want to see happen in hundreds of
thousands of places around the world.''

   If togetherness is getting you down you
have an ally in a British psychiatrist who says solitude is more
than just OK.
   ``It is a fault of my profession that people have been made to
feel guilty'' if they enjoy time alone, said Anthony Storr, former
Oxford University lecturer in psychiatry and author of ``Solitude: A
Return to the Self.''
   ``The whole emphasis in social work and psychotherapy is all to
do with interpersonal relations,'' Storr said in a recent interview.
   ``I'm not saying people can do without personal relationships.
I'm saying it's not pathological'' to spend hours alone in some
activity.
   ``A great many people on phone-in programs in America seemed to
find it rather a relief,'' said Storr, whose book, published by
MacMillan Inc., was No. 6 for 1987 on The Washington Post
non-fiction best-seller list.
   On ``Jan Black's Journal,'' a radio call-in show on KCBS in San
Francisco, many callers ``thought of themselves as weird _ because
we are such a social society _ but they had a desire or need to
spend time by themselves. It gave them a certain sense of relief
that someone with his credentials said it's OK,'' said producer
Charlotte Lantz.
   ``I remember one caller in particular, a woman, who gave a big
kind of sigh of relief, after all the pressure to be with people,''
said Cordelia Maloney, producer of ``Extension 720,'' a call-in show
on WGN radio in Chicago.
   ``Particularly in the U.S., Canada and Western Europe there is a
cultural bias that people who want to be alone have something wrong
with them. That it's a sign of danger, especially in a kid. But
people do, in fact, need time to be alone,'' said psychology
professor Peter Suedfeld, dean of the Graduate Faculties at the
University of British Columbia in Canada.
   In the 1970s, Suedfeld studied prisoners in solitary confinement
and found that generally ``what they object to is not being alone,
but to harassment of guards, cold food, things like that.'' Some
even ``popped a guard in the nose'' to get put into solitary when
``the pressures of everyday conditions in the prison got to be too
much for them,'' he said.
   ``We have a social setup,'' said Storr, ``that makes people feel
guilty if they want to go off and read a book. Families say, `Why do
you want to do that?' Some people never have anything by themselves
in their lives.
   ``We need times when we don't have too much input.''
   And not just input from people, he said. ``We've got to a kind of
stage where people feel that if they haven't auditory stimulation,
something's wrong.
   ``If they didn't have the radio on, they might have some more
interesting thoughts. I always walk out of shops if there is music
going on.''
   People's fear of being without sounds comes from fear of
thoughts, Storr said. ``They don't want to face what they really
feel, they want to put out of their minds anything that's
upsetting.''
   Dr. Arnold Modell, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard
University, said, ``People need to maintain an area of themselves
that does not communicate with other people. That hasn't been known
as a basic human need, even among psychoanalysts. But most artists
know this to be true. People need to be within their own world, yet
maintaining contact with other people.''
   Asked why many readers seem to react with such relief toward
``Solitude,'' Dr. Arnold Richards, a New York Psychoanalytic Society
spokesman, said people often confuse life with psychoanalytic
exploration of relationships.
   ``Psychoanalytic theory does not tell people how to live their
lives,'' said Richards, a practicing psychoanalyst in New York City.
   ``It's been a fashion for many years to think that happiness
depends on personal relationships,'' said Storr. ``I'm not a zealous
person who is trying to convice everybody not to have a
relationship. I just want to give a little push on the pendulum the
other way.''

<HEAD>AIDS Fear Leads To Clotting Factor Shortage For Hemophiliacs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Perhaps the best thing that ever happened to 20,000
Americans with the bleeding disease hemophilia was the discovery of
treatment with a protein called factor VIII. It was also probably
the worst.
   Five-minute infusions of this natural substance overcome their
bodies' inability to form blood clots so they can lead nearly normal
lives. But the treatments also have given more than half of them
AIDS infections.
   The treatment has been made safe again, but another crisis looms.
Factor VIII is in severe, sometimes life-threateningly short supply.
   Doctors say that because of the shortage, most non-emergency
surgery has been postponed for hemophiliacs. Bleeding often is
treated with less than the recommended doses, sometimes with poor
results. Users have smaller reserves for emergencies and most have
stopped taking preventive doses.
   They also have had to rely more on cryoprecipitate, an older,
less convenient therapy that requires a trip to the hospital to
receive blood plasma that is rich in factor VIII. This treatment
carries the same very slight risk of AIDS as an ordinary blood
transfusion.
   Hemophiliacs represent just 1 percent of the 80,000 AIDS cases
reported in the United States since 1982. However, a larger
proportion of them are infected than are the other two major risk
groups, homosexual men and drug addicts.
   About 60 percent of U.S. hemophiliacs are infected, and for those
with the most severe form of the disease it's perhaps 80 percent to
90 percent, said Alan Brownstein, executive director of the National
Hemophilia Foundation.
   Factor VIII is derived from human blood. A single dose may
contain elements of blood from 20,000 people or more. During late
1970s and early 1980s, AIDS virus passed through the purification
process into factor VIII.
   Since then, factor VIII makers have adopted cleansing techniques,
and Brownstein believes clotting factor is now HIV-free. But it also
has become expensive and scarce. The new processes yield only about
half as much per liter as the earlier techniques. Factor VIII for
one person typically costs about $50,000 a year, Brownstein said.
   Factor VII was already in short supply at the start of 1988. But
the situation became much worse because of problems at the American
Red Cross, which produces about 20 percent of the country's clotting
factor.
   Since then, the Red Cross has released little factor VIII,
although it recently resumed production. Meanwhile, about 7 percent
of the nation's usual annual production is on hold. Officials of the
Red Cross and U.S. Food and Drug Administration believe it safe. But
because of errors in production, the FDA says it would be breaking
agency rules if its release was allowed.

<NOTE>Solar Cooker Promoted As Benefit To Third World Women</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A simple box of cardboard, foil and glass is
being promoted as a means to free Third World women from the
time-consuming search for firewood and get them out of the unhealthy
smoke of wood cookfires.
   The solar cookers, designed by two Arizona women, are being
introduced in the Third World by Pillsbury Co. ``We feel the
potential of solar cookers is so great that it could truly alleviate
some of the global problems,'' said William H. Sperber, a senior
research microbiologist at the food conglomerate.
   The United Nations estimates 1.5 billion people are affected by
firewood shortages, said Robert Metcalf, a microbiologist at
California State University-Sacramento who attended graduate school
with Sperber at the University of Wisconsin 20 years ago and is
working with Pillsbury.
   The cooker is an insulated box within a box topped with a glass
pane and a reflector that directs sunlight. It can be made out of
cardboard or wood, and aluminum foil. Food is cooked in dark,
covered metal, glass or ceramic pots.
   The temperature peaks at 250-275 degrees, meaning food takes
longer to cook than in electric ovens. But Metcalf says users save
time by no longer having to collect firewood and by not having to
stir the food because of the low heat.
   Simplicity may be an obstacle to widespread adoption, supporters
say, and eaarlier, flawed cookers also have discouraged widespread
use.
   Barbara Kerr of Taylor, Ariz., a nurse, and Sherry Cole of Tempe,
a former free-lance writer and neighbor of Kerr's, created their
design in the 1970s. Since then, Cole said, they've sold about 3,000
kits and cookers ranging from $40 to $275 and several thousand
plans, from $1 to $3.75.

<HEAD>Scientists Trying To Develop Cosmic Dust Catcher For Space Station</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists are trying to find ways to
catch cosmic dust that could provide clues about the origins of life
and the solar system.
   Complicating the problem is that the dust particles zip through
space at 22,370 mph and ``you must catch them with minimum damage,
sort of like catching a ball with a pillow,'' says Joel Williams of
Los Alamos National Laboratory.
   The particles often are smaller than one-thousandth of an inch
across.
   Williams and colleagues at Los Alamos are evaluating dust
catchers for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
which wants one on its proposed space station. The device would look
like a foot-thick wall measuring 10-by-10 feet, and would be in
place up to a year because dust ``hits'' are rare, said scientist
Debra Wrobleski.
   ``Many particles striking the collector would come from comets
and asteroids, and studying their chemical composition and structure
could provide clues about the origin and evolution of the solar
system,'' Los Alamos said. By catching particles from outside the
solar system, scientists can learn if they contain substances that
help form amino acids, the building blocks of life.
   The scientists have found a number of potentially useful
materials among the foams and stacks of superthin metal foils they
evaluated with an electron micropscope and other methods. The
materials include polystyrene foams and gold, aluminum and beryllium
foils.

<NOTE>Geological Survey Publishes Inventory Of Antarctic Glaciers</NOTE>
<DATELINE>RESTON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Studies of how Earth's climate and Antarctic
ice influence each other will be aided by a newly published
inventory of the icy continent's glaciers, the U.S. Geological
Survey says.
   The 278-page atlas of satellite images of Antarctica is the first
chapter in ``Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World,'' an
11-chapter volume being prepared by the agency. The complete atlas
will provide a global snapsnot of glaciers as they were photographed
in the 1970s by the Landsat satellite.
   Comparing atlas images with other maps and aerial photographs,
can help scientists determine how the area covered by glaciers
fluctuates due to natural or human-caused warming or cooling, said
geologist Richard S. Williams Jr.
   ``The enormous area of ice concentrated in the glaciers of
Antarctica _ about 5.3 million square miles, including 91 percent of
the total volume of glacier ice on Earth _ influences the
temperature, wind and weather patterns over the entire Earth,'' said
Williams, a co-editor of the atlas project.
   ``Changes in the volume and dynamics of the ice sheet, therefore
may cause global climate changes,'' he said. ``In turn, changes in
the temperature of the planet can affect the volume and dynamics of
the Antarctic ice sheet.''
   ``Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World _ Antarctica''
may be obtained by sending a $40 check or money order with a request
for USGS Professional Paper 1386-B to Books and Open-Files Reports,
U.S. Geological Survey, Denver Federal Center, Box 25425, Denver,
Colo. 80225. Checks should be made out to Department of the
Interior-USGS.

<NOTE>Improvements In Fat Suction Surgery Safety</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computerized suction pump and monitor
can help surgeons remove the right amount of fat and prevent
dangerously excessive blood loss in patients undergoing cosmetic
liposuction surgery.
   Liposuction is the most common U.S. plastic surgery procedure
done for aesthetic purposes, says the Illinois-based American
Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, which published a
study about the pump-monitor in the Journal of Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgery.
   During liposuction, the surgeon inserts a small, blunt-tipped
metal tube into a pocket of fat, commonly in the hips, thighs or
abdomen. A suction pump connected to the tube sucks the fat into a
bottle.
   But even a small amount of blood turns the bottle's contents dark
red, so blood loss is difficult to determine, said Dr. Harvey Lash,
a plastic surgeon at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation and nearby
Stanford University.
   ``The exact determination of blood loss ... is important'' to
prevent shock or anemia, Lash said. ``Guess or estimate may not
allow the precise replacement of blood and fluids needed for the
safety of the patient.''
   Precise measurement of fat removal also helps surgeons suck the
same amount of fat from both sides of the body to give a balanced
appearance.
   The new pump has a color monitor that instantaneously shows the
amount of blood and fat removed. Lash and his colleagues were among
the first to test the device, which was developed by his son,
physician-engineer Bob Lash, and is now being marketed nationally.
   The device monitors fat and blood loss using two electrodes in
the bottle. Fat cells don't transmit electricity, but blood
transmits it well. The device determines the ratio of removed blood
and fat by measuring the amount of electricity that moves from one
electrode to another.

<HEAD>A Particular Cold, Like A Flu Strain, Has A Life Of Its Own</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sniff. Hack. Honk.
   If it seems to you that you have the same exact cold as everybody
you know _ maybe the throat's not too bad, but the sneezing is
relentless, or the cough is terrible but the sniffles haven't shown
up _ you're probably right.
   There are ``a couple of hundred'' viruses that can cause the
common cold, according to Dr. Larry Anderson, a virus specialist
with the national Centers for Disease Control. ``There will be a
range, of maybe more than one agent, circulating at a given time _
but you also may have one predominant virus.''
   And a certain virus, he said, ``will have certain types of
symptoms.''
   Thus, it's not surprising when everyone in the office is
spreading what comes to be known as ``the same cold.''
   ``They're likely to have the same virus,'' Anderson said.
   During the winter, a particular influenza strain often comes to
dominate the flu season from coast to coast. A particular cold
virus, however, doesn't usually spread that far, Anderson noted:
``By and large, other viruses don't spread in a national pattern
like flu does.''
   The cold going around ``may vary from community to community, or
even from time to time within the community,'' he said. ``There can
be one, or several types of rhinoviruses causing the colds.''
   There are a number of government agencies doing research on the
common cold _ one of the most loathed diseases around, albeit not
the most serious.
   The CDC and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases study colds. The Food and Drug Administration evaluates
cold treatments. Even the National Center for Health Statistics
keeps some facts and figures on the disease-related impact of colds.
   But with all that, there's no cure in sight _ partly because a
cure would have to be able to wipe out some 200 specific viruses.
   ``There's so many of them, it's not like you can develop one
vaccine that will take care of the common cold,'' Anderson said.
``If you develop one, other viruses are going to evade it.''

   Working families with children and incomes
under $18,576 may qualify for a ``tax refund'' even if they owe no
tax.
   The special benefit is called the earned-income credit, and can
be worth up to $874 in savings. A qualifying worker can arrange to
have the credit paid out in advance in paychecks throughout the year.
   In general, the credit is available to any worker who received
wages, tips, fees or other earned income in 1988 and whose adjusted
gross income was less than $18,576. The worker must have had a
dependent child living with him or her for more than six months last
year.
   A married worker must file a joint return to qualify for the
credit; it also is available to a person whose filing status is
qualified widow or widower with a dependent child, or head of
household.
   Instructions accompanying tax Forms 1040 and 1040A tell how to
determine if you can claim the credit. IRS Publication 596 has a

   The tax, approved by voters in November and effective Jan. 1,
jumped from a dime to 35 cents on a pack of cigarettes and raised
the price of cigars, chewing tobacco, snuff and pipe tobacco by 42
percent.
   The hike makes California's tobacco tax one of the nation's

<TEXT>
   The 1988 presidential campaign and the makers of
Scotch Tape, Eveready Batteries and Jordache Basics jeans produced
some of the worst _ albeit memorable _ advertisements of last year,
Adweek magazine said in a survey released today.
   In announcing its 7th annual ``Badvertising Awards,'' the weekly
trade magazine denounced the presidential campaign for showing
voters ``some incompetent advertising.''
   It cited the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis, in particular, for its so-called ``handlers''
series. The television ads showed actors portraying cynical Bush
handlers trying to disguise their candidate's alleged shortcomings.
   Adweek also said, ``Some ads run by pro-Bush organizations were
so distateful that the Bush campaign was obliged to disown them.''
   The magazine said the results of its survey were based on
comments from its editorial staffers and readers.
   ``Every year we all see hundreds of ads that are forgettably bad.
A few ads, though, manage to be memorably bad,'' the trade magazine
said in its Jan. 16 issue.
   Among the other recipients of Adweek's Badvertising Award:
   _Scotch Tape for its ``mean-spirited spot demonstrating the
product's effectiveness by dunking a woman repeatedly into a tank of
water.''
   _Eveready Batteries for ``its insensitivey to contemporay
realities.'' The spot in question featured a gun-toting toddler with
the appellation, ``Holy Terror,'' which Adweek claimed was too
easily translated to ``terrorist.''
   _Jordache Basics for ``featuring whining teens making no
particular point in their 30-second spot.''
   _Mercedes S. Class because it ``glamorizes fast driving and gives
reckless speeding an inapprorpiately upscale gloss.''
   _AT&amp;T International Long Distnce for a spot that contains
``dialogue between two colleagues (that) suggests that backstabbing
is the only way to get ahead in business.''

<HEAD>OPEC and non-OPEC Members to Meet Jan. 26 in London</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subroto as one name is correct</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members and non-members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet Jan. 26 in London to
discuss ways of cooperating to stabilize the world oil market,
OPEC's secretary general said Monday.
   Indonesia's Subroto also said that OPEC had no confirmation of
published reports that the United Arab Emirates was exceeding its
production quota agreed upon at an OPEC meeting last November.
   The January meeting will include representatives of the 13-member
cartel, but not necessarily the countries' oil ministers, Subroto
indicated to reporters after meeting with Egypt oil minister
Abdel-Hady Kandil.
   The Indonesian minister, who arrived in Cairo Sunday night, is
touring non-OPEC oil-producing countries, and already has visited
Colombia and Mexico. He is to depart Wednesday for Oman.
   Subroto said his purpose is to determine ``what OPEC and non-OPEC
(nations) can do together.''
   Subroto and Kandil said that non-OPEC oil-producing countries
will hold a meeting of their own in London Jan. 25 at Oman's
request. Then, experts from OPEC and non-OPEC countries would meet
the following day to prepare the ground for a ministerial meeting
later, he said.
   ``We discussed cooperation and what we shall do together to bring
stability in the oil market,'' Subroto said of his talks with
Kandil. ``Certainly one aspect of that cooperation is how to
influence supply, and OPEC has done its part already by the November
agreement to reduce production and I think it is now time that
non-OPEC producers will also contribute.''
   Kandil however, ruled out any further reduction of Egypt's
production. He said that since October 1984, Egypt had reduced its
daily output in support of OPEC policies.
   Egypt is not a member of OPEC but its oil policy is generally
guided by the cartel's actions.
   Subroto said that OPEC's eight-minister monitoring committee has
closely followed each member's output, looking for possible
violations of quotas. Asked about published reports that the United
Arab Emirates was exceeding its quota, Subroto said there was no
evidence to support such a claim.
   Subroto said that world oil prices were ``developing very much
positively'' thanks to observance of last November's OPEC quotas and
cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers.
   OPEC agreed late last year to reduce its oil output to 18.5
million barrels a day from more than 22 million barrels starting
Jan. 1. Since the agreement, world oil prices have risen steadily
from around the $12-$13-a-barrel range to the $16-$17 range.
   The new quota is to remain in effect for six months.

<HEAD>Demand For GM Trucks, Vans Spawns Talk Of Assembly Expansion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. is contemplating an expansion
of its minivan and sport-utility vehicle assembly capacity to meet
record demand for the light trucks.
   GM President Robert C. Stempel said truck-building capability may
be increased to meet demand for GM's M-vans, the rear-wheel-drive
Chevrolet Astro and GMC Safari minivans built in Baltimore.
   ``I need a whole lot more M-vans and I need a whole lot more
utility vehicles,'' Stempel told The Oakland Press during an
interview at the North American International Auto Show, which
opened Saturday in Detroit.
   Stempel said adding truck assembly capacity is only in the
discussion stage.
   Donald F. Ephlin, United Auto Workers union vice president in
charge of the union's GM department, said he was unaware of any
plans to increase truck production.
   But Ephlin said expansion discussions are ``only logical,'' given
the demand for light trucks.
   GMC and Chevrolet, which market GM's light truck lineup, set
sales records in 1988.
   Sport-utility vehicles are built in Pontiac, Mich., and GM is
revamping a plant in Moraine, Ohio, to build a new four-door utility
vehicle due out next year.

   If you are still reeling from having to deal
with a thoroughly rewritten federal income tax last year, take
heart. This year there are only a few changes _ and most of them are
beneficial.
   There's another bit of good news. Because April 15 falls on a
Saturday, you have two extra days to file your 1988 return.
   Most of the changes enacted by Congress in 1986 were in effect
when returns were filed last year. Deductions for sales taxes and
for two-earner couples were repealed; the preference for capital
gains was wiped out; Individual Retirement Accounts were limited,
and new restrictions were placed on deductions for consumer interest
and medical and miscellaneous expenses.
   Those changes paid for lower tax rates and for higher exemptions
and standard deductions.
   For 1988 returns, exemptions and standard deductions are higher
still, and most people will find their rates have dropped again. The
most significant change that could bring higher taxes for some
people is a further tightening of the deduction for consumer
interest.
   The major changes:
   PERSONAL EXEMPTION: You may exempt from taxation $1,950 for
yourself, your spouse and each dependent, up from $1,900 last year.
A student or other person who can be claimed as an exemption by
another _ such as a parent _ may not take an exemption on his or her
own return.
   STANDARD DEDUCTIONS: A couple that does not itemize deductions
may reduce income subject to taxation by $5,000; for a single
person, the deduction is $3,000; for a head of household, $4,400;
for a married person filing a separate return, $2,500. In each case,
a person over 65 or blind gets a higher deduction; for example, a
married couple over 65 with one spouse blind and filing jointly is
allowed $6,800. A person who can be claimed as a dependent is
allowed as little as $500, depending on type and size of income.
   TAX RATES: Last year, there were five rate brackets, from 11
percent to 38{ percent. Now there are four: 15 percent, 28 percent,
33 percent, and 28 percent again. For most taxpayers, it makes no
difference how many rates there are, since they still determine how
much they owe by looking at a tax table. The net result is that
under the new law, most people will pay a smaller part of their
taxable income to the government _ although more of their income may
be taxable.
   MORTGAGE INTEREST: A homeowner now may deduct interest on up to
$1 million of debt used to acquire one or two homes plus up to
$100,000 of home-equity loans. There are no restrictions on how the
equity loan can be spent.
   CONSUMER INTEREST: Only 40 percent of interest paid on loans for
education, automobiles, credit cards and other personal debt is
deductible on 1988 returns, down from 65 percent the previous year.
   INVESTMENT INTEREST: Deductible interest paid to make investments
is limited to net investment income plus $4,000. Any excess may be
``carried over'' into future years and deducted against investment
income.
   EARNED-INCOME CREDIT: This benefit for lower-income working
families with dependent children has been increased to a maximum of
$874, up from $849. Families with earned income as high as $18,756
may qualify, up from $15,432 in 1987.
   MUTUAL FUNDS: Publicly offered mutual funds will not report
certain operating expenses as income to shareholders for 1988 and
1989; thus, shareholders will not have to report such amounts as
income or write them off as miscellaneous deductions. This is the
same treatment allowed for 1987.

   The new federal tax law has raised the tax-free
level to the point that a married couple under 65 may have total
income of up to $8,899 and not have to file a return.
   Just two years ago, a couple had to file if income was $5,830 or
more, as did a single person whose income was at least $3,560. Now,
a single person under 65 need not file until income hits $4,950.
   Whether you have to file depends on your income and your filing
status. You must file if your income is more than the total of the
personal exemptions for yourself and any spouse plus your basic
standard deduction.
   In most cases, the filing thresholds are higher if one or both
spouses is over the age of 65. But they do not increase
automatically because of blindness, as the standard deduction does.
   Most married couples will find it advantageous to file a joint
return, even though both spouses earn income. But there are
exceptions, and the only way to be certain you are making the right
choice is to figure your taxes twice _ once on a joint return and
once on separate returns.
   Here are guidelines for the various filing statuses:
   MARRIED FILING JOINTLY: You must have been married on Dec. 31,
1988; although there is no requirement that you and your spouse be
living together, you may not be legally separated. Each spouse is
liable for the full amount of tax, even though one earned no income.
The filing thresholds: $8,900 if both spouses are under 65; $9,500
if one is 65 or older, and $10,100 if both are 65 or older.
   MARRIED FILING SEPARATELY: The definition of ``married'' is the
same as with a joint return. But if you file separately, the filing
threshold is $1,950 regardless of age. You report only your income
and none of your spouse's, and claim only your deductions. If one
spouse itemizes deductions, so must the other.
   Some people may save money by filing separately. For example, if
one spouse has a large amount of medical or unreimbursed employee
expenses, more of those deductions could be claimed by filing
separately.
   That is because only medical expenses exceeding 7.5 percent of
adjusted gross income and only miscellaneous expenses exceeding 2
percent of AGI may be deducted. If, for example, you have $5,000 of
unreimbursed medical expenses, it would be easier to exceed 7{
percent of your income than to exceed 7{ percent of the combined
income of both spouses.
   HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD: If you qualify for these tax rates, which are
about midway between those for singles and couples filing jointly,
you will have to file a return if income is $6,350 or more, assuming
you are under 65, or at least $7,100 if 65 or older.
   In general, you qualify if:
   _ You were unmarried at yearend (or your spouse did not live in
your home during the last six months of the year), and:
   _ You paid over half the cost of maintaining your home as the
principal residence of your unmarried child or grandchild, or of a
married child or grandchild whom you can claim as a dependent, or of
any other relative whom you can claim.
   SURVIVING SPOUSE: If your spouse died last year and you did not
remarry, filing thresholds are the same as for a married couple
filing jointly. You may claim a $1,950 personal exemption for your
spouse and file a joint return for 1988. As a rule, you may use
joint tax rates _ but not claim an exemption for the spouse _ for
two additional years following the year of death of a spouse if you
furnish over half the cost of keeping a home for your dependent
child.
   SINGLE: You must file if income is $4,950 or more, if under 65;
or $5,700, if 65 or older. You are considered single if you were
legally separated or unmarried on Dec. 31, 1988.
   The rules are different if you can be claimed as a dependent by
someone else. If all your income was earned _ wages, tips,
scholarships _ your filing threshold is $3,000. If you had any
earned income, such as interest and dividends, and you are under 65,
your threshold is $500. The figure rises to $1,100 if you are
married and 65 or older, and to $1,250 if you are single and 65 or
older.

   Think back to 1986, when Congress passed and
President Reagan signed a sweeping overhaul of the income tax.
Remember all the crowing about how there would be only two simple
tax rates? Forget it.
   Look at the 1988 tax rate schedules in your package of tax forms
and you'll see there actually are four marginal rates: 15 percent,
28 percent, 33 percent and 28 percent again.
   Where simplicity is concerned, as long as there is more than one
rate, it makes little difference whether there are two or 20.
   That is because the great majority of taxpayers have no contact
with tax rates when they fill out their returns. Unless you have
taxable income _ which is what is left after subtracting personal
exemptions and deductions from your income _ of $50,000 or more, you
simply look at the tax tables, find your income, read across the
page to your filing status and see what you owe.
   About four of every five taxpayers will pay only the lowest rate,
15 percent, on money earned last year. These people have taxable
incomes of up to $17,850 if single and up to $29,750 if married and
filing joint returns.
   When President Reagan proposed across-the-board tax cuts in 1981,
his goal was to give people incentive to work more and save more in
ways that would improve the economy. He proposed to do this by
cutting ``marginal tax rates'' as low as possible. Congress and the
president had the same thought in mind when they approved the 1986
overhaul.
   A marginal rate is what you would pay on any additional dollars
you earned. For example, if you are married and have taxable income
of $27,000, your top marginal rate is 15 percent; you are said to be
in the 15 percent bracket. Earn another $1 or $1,000 and it still is
15 percent.
   But earn $3,000 more and your top rate jumps to 28 percent. You
would pay 15 percent on the first $29,750 and 28 percent on the
excess _ that is, on $250. You have jumped into the 28 percent
bracket.
   When Reagan took office, the top marginal rate was 70 percent.
Now, it is 33 percent, although backers of the overhaul like to
claim it is 28 percent.
   Here's how that works:
   Remember that for a single person, for example, the first $17,850
of income subject to taxation is taxed at 15 percent. Any additional
income between $17,850 and $43,150 is taxed at 28 percent. Anything
between $43,150 and $89,560 is taxed at 33 percent _ and then comes
the complication: The $89,560 upper limit is increased by $10,920
for each personal exemption claimed. Thus, a single person with a
dependent child pays 33 percent on taxable income between $43,150
and $111,400.
   And finally, any additional dollars above the top limit are taxed
at 28 percent.
   Why jump from a 28 percent rate to 33 percent and back to 28
percent again? The answer is that congressional tax writers wanted
to have what appeared to be a top rate of 28 percent but did not
like the idea of having a person with $20,000 of taxable income pay
the same top rate as one with $2 million.
   The solution was to deny wealthier Americans any benefit of the
bottom rate of 15 percent and any benefit from the personal
exemption. The net result was to impose a flat tax rate of about 28
percent _ it can be more, depending on the number of exemptions _ on
every taxable dollar earned by these people.
   As a side-effect, the well-to-do taxpayers who fall into this
category are facing a 33 percent marginal tax rate on some of the
extra dollars they earn above the 28 percent bracket. For a single
person with no dependents, this surcharge applies on up to $57,330
of income _ that is, on everything between $43,150 and $100,480; for
a couple with two children, the higher rate applies to $121,030 _
everything between $71,900 and $192,930.
   The more children in the family, the more income that is taxed at
the 33 percent rate.

   For the second time in two years, Congress has
changed the rules for deducting interest on a home mortgage. Most
taxpayers will find the new version more advantageous but they also
will be able to deduct less consumer interest.
   In general, you may deduct interest on up to $1 million borrowed
to buy, build or improve your principal home and second home and on
an additional $100,000 for a home-equity loan whose proceeds may be
used for any purpose. But some conditions and definitions make the
rules considerably more complex.
   Under the 1986 tax overhaul, only 40 percent of interest paid in
1988 on credit cards, auto loans, education loans and similar
consumer borrowing may be deducted. That is down from 65 percent
allowed in 1987.
   There are similar restraints on investment interest, with an
added attraction: If your 1988 investment income was too low to
allow you to deduct all your investment interest, you may be able to
carry it over and write it off in a future year.
   But back to mortgage interest.
   If your outstanding mortgages were taken out before Oct. 14,
1987, all the interest on one or two homes is deductible and the $1
million limitation does not apply. Qualifying loans include money
borrowed to buy or improve a home, as well as home-equity loans,
which usually are incurred after a person has lived in a home for a
while.
   If you borrowed to buy, build, improve or refinance a home after
Oct. 13, 1987, the law draws a distinction between acquisition debt
and home-equity debt.
   _ ACQUISITION DEBT: This is money borrowed to buy, build or
substantially improve a first or second home. Interest on up to $1
million may be deducted, but that total is reduced by the amount of
any outstanding mortgage that was taken out before Oct. 14, 1987.
You must be able to prove that a loan was actually used for such
purpose; the Internal Revenue Service will accept as proof evidence
of acquisition costs incurred within 90 days before or after a loan
was closed.
   _ HOME-EQUITY DEBT: Interest on up to $100,000 of debt is fully
deductible even though the proceeds of the loan are used for
non-housing purposes; the loan must be secured by a mortgage on your
home. There is one catch: you may not deduct interest on money
borrowed to make investments (such as municipal bonds) whose
interest is tax-exempt.
   The maximum deductible equity loan is the value of your home
minus any outstanding acquisition debt, or $100,000, whichever is
smaller.
   For purposes of a tax deduction, your principal home may be a
cooperative unit, condominium, houseboat or trailer. The second home
is a vacation home or other place that you may or may not rent out
part of the time; if it is rented out, you must use it at least 14
days a year or 10 percent of the number of days it is rented.
   If your mortgage interest payments for 1988 totaled $600 or more,
the company or person holding the mortgage is required to send you a
Form 1098 by Jan. 31 showing how much interest you paid. The lender
also sends a copy to the IRS.
   Mortgage points may be deducted if they are normally charged in
your area as a cost of getting a loan and if they are viewed as
interest _ not as service charges. They may be fully deductible in
the year paid only on loans to buy or improve your principal home.
Otherwise, they must be written off gradually over the life of the
loan.
   However, the Tax Court recently upheld the IRS position that
points paid to refinance a mortgage are not deductible.
   To be deductible, points should be paid by separate check and not
simply withheld from the proceeds of the loan.
   If your income and deductions are high enough, you may be subject
to the alternative minimum tax, a flat 21 percent levy, which could
dilute the value of your mortgage deduction.
   Form 6251 and its instructions let you know if you are subject to
the minimum tax. Publication 545 spells out the rules for interest
deductions. Publication 936 gives the specifics on the mortgage
interest deduction.

   Tax overhaul is making taxpayers _ or at least
first-time return filers _ of many younger Americans.
   The 1986 law, while lowering rates and raising exemptions, bars a
child from taking any exemption if he or she can be claimed as a
dependent by a parent or someone else. In many cases it reduces the
standard deduction for dependents. And it requires any dependent
with interest, dividends or other unearned income totaling as little
as $501 to file a return.
   Each personal exemption means a $1,950 reduction in 1988 income
subject to taxation. For most taxpayers, that is a saving of $292.50
in taxes; for those in the 28 percent tax bracket, it is a saving of
up to $546.
   Five tests must be met for you to claim a person as your
dependent:
   _ The dependent must be a resident or citizen of the United
States or a resident of Canada or Mexico.
   _ He or she must not have filed a joint return with a spouse.
   _ The dependent must be your child, grandchild, parent,
grandparent, brother, sister, nephew, niece, uncle, aunt, son- or
daughter-in-law, parent-in-law, brother- or sister-in-law, or any
person who is a member of your household and lived with you
throughout the year.
   _ The dependent's gross income for 1988 must have been less than
$1,950. This does not apply to your dependent child who either was
under 19 at the end of the year or was a full-time student.
   _ You must have furnished more than half the dependent's support
during the year. (There are exceptions if you are divorced.) Support
includes foot, lodging, clothing, education, medical care,
transportation, toys, pocket money, etc.
   If all those conditions are met, you may take an exemption for a
dependent. But that dependent cannot take an exemption on his or her
personal tax return _ even if you don't actually claim it.
   So, how are your family's taxes affected if your 17-year-old
daughter had a part-time job and a small savings account last year?
She earned $2,500 in the job and $200 interest.
   You, the parent, are allowed to claim her as a dependent. For
that reason, and because her gross income exceeds $500, she must
file a return as well. Her standard deduction is her total earned
income or $3,000 (the usual standard deduction for a single person),
whichever is smaller. Since her earned income _ wages, tips, fees
and the like _ was $2,500, that also is her standard deduction.
   She should file the simplest form, 1040EZ. Only $200 of her
income would be taxable and her tax liability (from the tax table on
page 37 in the instructions) would be $32.
   In the unlikely event that your daughter had itemized deductions
exceeding $2,500, it would be to her advantage to itemize rather
than take the standard deduction. She then would have to file Form
1040 and Schedule A, rather than 1040EZ.
   If she had no unearned income _ such as interest and dividends _
she would not have to file a return unless her earned income
exceeded $3,000. But she should file to get a refund of any income
tax that was withheld from her earnings.
   In any case, the standard deduction for a person who can be
claimed as a dependent of another may not exceed $500 of the
dependent's earned income _ whichever is greater.
   The real complications occur when your child is under 14 and has
unearned income of more than $1,000. In that case, some of the
child's income will be taxed at your, presumably higher, maximum tax
rate. You should read the instructions for Form 8615, which may have
to be attached to your child's return.
   This new provision is aimed at deterring the avoidance of tax by
a parent's shifting of income-producing property to a child.
   Remember that you must list on your tax return the Social
Security number of any child age 5 or older whom you claim as a
dependent.

   Once you determine that you must file a federal
tax return, the question is which form to use. The answer depends on
your income and marital status and whether you itemize deductions.
   Use the simplest form _ the one-page Form 1040EZ _ if you are
single, you have no other dependents, you don't itemize and your
taxable income (gross income minus any personal exemption) is less
than $50,000. Your income must have come solely from wages, tips or
taxable scholarships, except for up to $400 interest.
   The two-page 1040A is for any filing status (married, single,
head of household), allows any number of exemptions but no itemized
deductions and is restricted to those whose taxable income is under
$50,000. But within that income limit you may have, in addition to
wages, tips and scholarships, any amount of interest, dividends and
unemployment compensation.
   A 1040A filer must attach Schedule 1 if an Individual Retirement
Account deduction or child-care credit is claimed, or if dividends
or taxable interest exceed $400.
   The long Form 1040 is required for filers who don't qualify for a
shorter one. That includes, for example, anyone who received taxable
Social Security benefits or made estimated tax payments in 1988.

   Something new has been added to your federal
tax package, but you probably should not take it too seriously.
   As part of a government effort to reduce paperwork, the Internal
Revenue Service now is required to estimate how much time it will
take to fill out your return. So, on Page 3 of your instruction
booklet you will find a table estimating the average time required
for record-keeping, learning about tax law or the form, preparing
the form and for copying, assembling and sending the form to the IRS.
   The filer of a long Form 1040 could be a four-member family
struggling to stay above the poverty line, with $25,000 income and
no itemized deductions. Or the filer could be a millionaire whose
stock transactions require a 100-page document just to list.
   Nevertheless, the IRS estimates, average all the 1040 filers
together and record-keeping will require 3 hours and 7 minutes;
learning about the law or the form, 2 hours and 28 minutes;
preparing the form, another 3 hours and 7 minutes, and the rest of
the work, 35 minutes.
   Throw in a Schedule A for itemized deductions and the ``average''
1040 filer is looking at 13 hours and 51 minutes.

   An Individual Retirement Account can be a
valuable asset for your later years and, if you qualify, reduce your
current taxes as well.
   Even though your income may be too high to qualify you for a
tax-deductible IRA, it still may be to your advantage to have a
non-deductible IRA. Interest that your IRA earns will not be taxed
until you make a withdrawal from the account, presumably after you
pass the age of 59{.
   There still is time to open an IRA for 1988; you have until
midnight April 17, the deadline for filing your tax return.
   If you are single and not covered by a company pension plan, your
IRA contribution is fully deductible, no matter how high your
income. If you are covered by a company plan, you qualify for a full
deduction so long as your adjusted gross income is $25,000 or less;
you get a partial deduction if income is between $25,000 and
$35,000, and no deduction once income hits $35,000.
   Similarly, if neither spouse is under a company pension plan, a
couple may make a fully deductible contribution no matter how high
their income. But if one or both spouses is in a company plan, a
full contribution is deductible only if income on a joint return is
$40,000 or less. A reduced deduction is allowed as income rises
above $40,000; no deduction is permitted above the $50,000 income
level.
   In any case, if the income limitations restrict you to a $10 or
$20 deduction, for example, you may deduct at least $200. That means
that if you qualify for a deduction at all, you may claim $200 _
assuming you actually contributed that much to your IRA.
   Whether your IRA contribution is fully or partially deductible or
not deductible at all, the maximum deposit is 100 percent of your
earned income, up to $2,000. If one spouse has a paying job and the
other does not, each may have an IRA but total contributions may not
exceed $2,250 a year. That can be divided in any number of ways, so
long as neither account gets more than $2,000.
   To claim a deduction for an IRA contribution, you must file
either Form 1040A plus Schedule 1, or the long Form 1040. Calculate
your deduction by using one of the two worksheets in the
instructions.
   Use Form 8606 to report any non-deductible IRA contributions; if
you and your spouse each make such contributions, you must file
separate 8606s, even though you file a joint tax return. The same
form is used to report 1988 withdrawals from your IRA.
   It is important to retain a copy of your Form 8606 because you
may need it in the future to prove that your IRA contributions
already have been taxed.
   Publication 590, free from the IRS, explains what you need to
know about IRA contributions and withdrawals.

   The stock market was mixed today, running into
some resistance at its highest levels in nearly 15 months.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.61 to 2,192.68
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 580 up, 343 down and
482 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.74 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The market has benefited in recent sessions from buying by money
managers at investing institutions seeking to put some of their
large cash reserves to work at the start of a new year.
   But analysts said some traders were worried that the rally had
encountered some large obstacles.
   Each time the Dow Jones industrial average reached the 2,000
level last week, selling pressure seemed to intensify.
   In addition, brokers noted, the advance in stock prices of late
has come without any help from interest rates. Yields on
interest-bearing investments, especially in the short-term money
market, remain a strong competitive threat to stocks.
   Among actively traded blue chips, USX rose [ to 31[; Ford Motor
was unchanged at 51]; International Business Machines slipped [ to
121}, and General Electric was down ] at 44\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .03 to 157.99. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index climbed 1.08 to 312.48.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.75 to 2,194.29,
finishing the week with a net gain of 25.72 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 2 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 971 up, 509 down and 477 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 161.33 million shares, against 174.04
million in the previous session.

   You may have to pay income tax on up to half
the Social Security benefits you received in 1988.
   Part of your benefits is taxable if your total income _ including
half the benefits and all your tax-exempt interest _ exceeds $32,000
if you are married and filing a joint return. In the case of a
single person, the threshold is $25,000.
   If any of your Social Security is taxable, you will have to file
the long Form 1040.
   Assuming you and your spouse file a joint return, you received
$7,000 in Social Security benefits, your non-Social Security income
totaled $37,000, and you list income adjustments of $2,000, here is
how to determine what is taxable:
   _ Add half your Social Security ($3,500) to your other income,
including tax-exempt interest ($37,000): $40,500.
   _ Subtract any adjustments that you list on lines 24 through 29
on Form 1040, such as reimbursed employee business expenses and
alimony paid: $2,000. That leaves $38,500.
   _ Subtract the threshold for a couple filing jointly: $32,000.
That leaves $6,500. (If you get zero or less here, none of your
Social Security is taxable).
   _ Take half of that $6,500: $3,250.
   _ Compare that $3,250 with the $3,500 representing half your
Social Security benefits. You pay tax on the smaller _ $3,250. That
figure is reported as taxable Social Security on line 21b of 1040.
   If you are married, lived with your spouse at any time last year
and are filing a separate return, the threshold figure is zero. A
single person, head of household or married person who did not live
with a spouse at any time in 1988 has a $25,000 threshold.
   The government should send you by Jan. 31 a Form SSA-1099,
showing Social Security benefits you were paid last year. The
important figure is in Box 5.
   Use the same rules and computations if you received railroad
retirement benefits. In that case, you should receive Form RRB-1099
in the mail.
   Special rules apply if you repaid any Social Security benefits
last year. Publication 915, free from the IRS, explains this and
other details of determining if any portion of your benefits is
taxable.

   Up to 10 million families are expected to
reduce their 1988 tax bills by as much as $1,440 by claiming the
credit for dependent-care expenses.
   The credit generally is available to a taxpayer who, in order to
find or keep a job, pays another person to care for a child under 15
or other dependent. That dependent could be a disabled spouse; any
disabled person who could be claimed by the taxpayer as a dependent;
or a disabled person who had $1,950 or more in income and, thus,
could not be claimed by another.
   The hired person may not be your spouse, your child under the age
of 19 or any person you may claim as a dependent. In the case of a
couple, both spouses must work full time or part time to claim the
credit, unless one is a full-time student or is disabled.
   The credit applies to amounts paid for household services and
care of the dependent while the taxpayer works or looks for work.
These can include services of a cook, babysitter or housekeeper in
the home, as well as costs of outside care for a child under 15, but
not costs of overnight camp. Outside care for a disabled dependent
of any age also is covered if that person regularly spends at least
eight hours a day in your home.
   Special rules apply to children of divorced or separated parents.
   There are these limitations on the credit:
   _ The total of claimed dependent-care expenses may not exceed
your earned income (wages, fees, tips and the like) or, in the case
of a couple, the earnings of the lower-paid spouse.
   _ The maximum claimed expenses are $2,400 for one dependent and
$4,800 for two or more.
   _ The credit is for 30 percent of eligible expenses if your
adjusted gross income is $10,000 or less. It drops one percentage
point for each $2,000 of income; the credit is 20 percent for income
above $28,000.
   Taxpayers who file the long Form 1040 must also fill out Form
2441 to claim the credit. Filers of 1040A must attach Schedule 1.
   Claiming the child-care credit can bring these complications:
   _ If you pay $50 or more in a calendar quarter to someone who
cares for your dependent, you generally must pay Social Security tax
of 7.51 percent on those wages, withhold another 7.51 percent from
the worker's wages and forward the full 15.02 percent each quarter
by filing Form 942.
   _ Paying wages of $1,000 or more in a quarter may also subject
you to paying unemployment taxes. Get Form 940 for details.
   _ You may have to calculate whether you are subject to the
alternative minimum tax. This is a flat 21 percent tax that you pay
only if it exceeds your regular income tax; it is aimed at
preventing well-to-do people from totally avoiding taxes through use
of large deductions.
   Check the back of Form 2441 to see whether you should be
concerned about the minimum tax.

   It's easy to avoid the most common error found
on federal tax returns: Just be sure to claim the right standard
deduction.
   Every year the experts sample returns on which errors have been
found, and every year the results are the same: Thousands of
taxpayers who don't itemize deductions write down the wrong standard
deduction.
   The problem was made worse by the 1986 tax overhaul, which
limited the standard deduction for taxpayers _ mostly students _ who
can be claimed as a dependent by someone else. The new law also
complicated the standard deduction for those who are blind or at
least 65.
   If you file the long Form 1040, get your standard deduction from
page 17 of the instructions. See pages 28 and 29 if you file 1040A
or 1040EZ.
   Thousands of other taxpayers make errors in arithmetic, and
although such mistakes usually are caught by an IRS computer, they
likely will delay any refund.
   Another common error can be most costly. Large numbers of
lower-income working families that are eligible for the
earned-income credit fail to claim it; others make the wrong
calculations. To determine whether you are eligible, check the
worksheet on page 20 of the 1040 instructions or page 35 of the
1040A instructions.
   Some other things to remember:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ Be sure you copy the right figure when you read across the tax
tables to find your tax liability.
   _ Even the rule for rounding off to whole dollars has been
complicated. The IRS says, for example that you may round off $1.39
to $1, and $2.50 to $3. But if you have to add two or more figures
to arrive at the amount to enter on a line, round off only the total
_ not the individual figures.
   _ If you had two or more employers and earned more than $45,000
last year, you may have had too much Social Security tax withheld
from your paychecks. The excess may be subtracted from income taxes
owed.
   _ Tax on your Series E or EE U.S. savings bonds is due no later
than when they are redeemed. However, you may choose to report the
interest each year when it accrues and pay tax annually.
   _ The law says you have not filed a return unless it is signed.
You could face a $500 penalty for filing a return that does not
include basic information necessary to determine your tax liability.
And even if you feel the need to protest, don't cross out or alter
the ``under penalties of perjury'' declaration just above the
signature line; that would void the return.
   _ Keep all records pertaining to your taxes for at least three
years. Records on the sale, purchase or improvement of property,
including your home, should be kept permanently, as should paperwork
on your Individual Retirement Account.
   _ You must file Schedule B (for Form 1040) or Schedule 1 (for
1040A) if you received taxable interest or dividends exceeding $400.
   _ The IRS needs to know how much tax-exempt interest you received
last year; it should be listed on line 8b. Don't include interest
earned on your Individual Retirement Account.
   _ By Feb. 15 you should receive from your employer a W-2 form
showing your 1988 income. If you don't, ask for it. Lack of a W-2
does not excuse you from filing and paying any due tax by the April
17 deadline.
   _ If you cannot complete your return by the deadline, file a Form
4868 instead, which gives you an automatic extension to Aug. 15.
However, you must estimate how much tax you owe and send a check for
that amount with Form 4868.
   _ The sequence numbers listed under ``1988'' in the upper right
corner of your tax forms tell you in what order the supplemental
forms and schedules should be attached to your 1040.
   _ You may have heard that if you use the preprinted stick-on
label on your return, you are making it easier for the IRS to select
your return for an audit. Nonsense, say experts outside the IRS; the
label simply makes it easier for your return to be processed through
a computer.
   _ If you are self-employed, you may deduct on line 6 of Form 1040
25 percent of what you paid for health insurance for yourself and
your family. The deduction may not exceed your net self-employment
income, and you don't get it if you are covered by an employer's
health insurance.
   _ Investors in enterprises that generate losses may be subject to
a whole new set of tax rules. In general, a loss from a passive
activity (something in which you do not materially participate) may
not be used to avoid taxes on non-passive income, such as wages.
Check IRS Publication 925.
   _ If you deduct alimony payments, your return must show the
Social Security number of the recipient; the recipient's return must
show your number.
   _ Don't forget to put a stamp on your envelope; it isn't a filed
return until it is received by the IRS, and the Postal Service
probably will not send it without a stamp.

   Recent tax laws have cut deeply into deductions
traditionally claimed by millions of taxpayers. Many writeoffs have
been lost entirely because of higher thresholds on deductions for
medical and miscellaneous expenses.
   But there still are enough deductions left to make it worthwhile
for one-third of taxpayers to itemize.
   One of the most expensive changes for individuals in the 1986 tax
overhaul was repeal of the deduction for state and local sales
taxes. But state and local income and property taxes are still
deductible.
   Only unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 7{ percent of
adjusted gross income may be deducted. Certain uninsured
non-business casualty losses, such as from fires, may be deducted
subject to a 10 percent threshold.
   There is a 2 percent limit on miscellaneous deductions that
applies to such things as unreimbursed employee expenses, including
union dues, tools, work clothes (but not if suitable for street
wear), protective safety shoes and glasses; investment expenses,
such as advice, subscriptions and rental of safe deposit boxes in
which investment-related papers are stored, and tax-preparation fees.
   1988 is the last year to deduct, subject to the 2 percent rule, a
portion of the basic monthly home telephone service charge as an
expense of producing income.
   Very few miscellaneous expenses may be deducted without regard to
the 2 percent threshold. These include certain work-related expenses
of handicapped people and gambling losses up to the amount of
gambling winnings.
   Some other deductions:
   _ If you use your own car for the benefit of a tax-exempt
charity, including driving to and from the organization, you may
deduct 12 cents a mile or the cost of gas and oil, plus (in either
case) parking fees and tolls.
   _ On the other hand, driving your child to the hospital gets you
a medical-expense deduction of only 9 cents a mile (or gas and oil)
plus parking and tolls. These transportation expenses are lumped in
with other reimbursed medical expenses and subject to the 7{ percent
threshold.
   Over the years, the definition of medical expenses has been
expanded. In addition to such traditional costs as physicians' and
dentists' fees and prescription drugs, the term can include a hair
transplant, drug-abuse treatment, a closed-caption television device
for the deaf, a facelift, or even musical lessons prescribed to
correct an overbite.
   _ Use Form 1040 line 28 to report penalties paid for early
withdrawal of savings; you won't be taxed on that amount.
   _ If you itemize, you may be able to write off certain expenses
incurred in connection with a job-related move if the new job is at
least 35 miles farther from your old home than was the old job. (For
example, if your old job was three miles from home, you new job must
be at least 38 miles from the old home.) If you had no previous job,
the new job must be 35 miles or more from your old home. Publication
521, free from the IRS, gives details.
   _ Use Form 8283 to report gifts other than money to charity when
the value exceeds $500. No breakdown is required on your return if
such gifts are $500 or less, but you would be wise to keep records.
In general, you are allowed a deduction for contributions of money
or ordinary-income property (as opposed to property that could
produce a capital gain) up to 30 percent of your adjusted gross
income.
   _ Non-business losses due to fire, theft, storm and similar
events may be deductible; misplacing or breaking a valuable item is
not a deductible loss. After absorbing the first $100 of each loss,
you may deduct only the total amount of all losses in a year that
exceed 10 percent of adjusted gross income. See Form 4684.
   Here are some expenses that are not deductible: scientology fees,
funeral expenses, health club dues, the value of your services
donated to charity, fines, termite or moth damage, over-the-counter
drugs even if prescribed, diaper service, gifts to foreign
charities, child support, and costs of commuting from home to work.

   There's a new twist in the tax law for sports
fans who give to the ol' alma mater.
   Even if your gift to a college or university entitles you to buy
season tickets, you still may take a charitable deduction for 80
percent of your donation.
   This new law, enacted last year, overturns a 1983 ruling by the
Internal Revenue Service.
   The IRS noted that in many cases, games are sold out long in
advance, and the only way to be assured of getting a ticket is to
make a donation to the college or its athletic programs. Therefore,
the IRS insisted, the privilege of buying a ticket had value, and a
charitable deduction is prohibited when the donor receives something
of value in return.
   Lawmakers would have none of that. So, under a 1988 law, you may
deduct 80 percent of such contributions if, as part of the
arrangemnt, you receive the right to purchase tickets. If you
receive no such right, the contribution is 100 percent deductible.
If you receive tickets as part of the deal, none of the contribution
may be deducted.
   The new law applies retroactively to contributions given after
Dec. 31, 1983.

   Capital gains are an aspect of tax law that
most people encounter only in connection with the sale of their
home. But in many cases, taxation on profits from a home sale is
deferred or avoided entirely.
   In general, the law treats such gains in much the same way that
it treats profits from the sale of stock, land, coins or other
property. That means any profit is taxable income, and under the new
law, there is no automatic exclusion of a portion of capital gains.
   However, there are two ``outs'' when the capital gain is from the
sale of your principal home:
   _ First, if certain conditions are met, any tax on the gain is
deferred so long as you buy a replacement home that costs at least
as much as your old home sold for. The replacement must be bought
within 24 months before or 24 months after the old one is sold.
   If your new one costs less than the ``adjusted'' selling price of
your old home, you pay tax on the profit from the sale or on the
portion of the sales price that exceeds the cost of the new home _
whichever is less. You reduce the tax bite by adjusting the sales
price of the old home to reflect points, fix-up expenses, real
estate commissions and legal fees you paid.
   Deferral of gain on your home sale is not optional _ you must do
it anytime you buy a principal home whose price equals or exceeds
the adjusted sales price of your old one.
   _ Second, if you or your spouse are 55 or older, you may avoid
tax on the first $125,000 of profits. This option is available only
once in a lifetime. To qualify, the property must have been your
principal home for at least three of the last five years before the
sale.
   The miscellaneous tax bill that Congress passed last October made
two minor changes affecting these provisions.
   One ensures that a couple will not be denied the benefits of the
deferral because one spouse dies after the old home is sold but
before the new one is bought.
   The second stipulates that a person 55 or older who becomes
mentally or physically incapable of self-care during the five-year
period preceding the home sale will be deemed to have met the
residency requirement if up to four of the five years are spent in a
nursing home.
   If you sold a principal home in 1988, you should check
Publication 523, which is free from the IRS. Whether you purchased a

   The Internal Revenue Service has a full library
of helpful tax information that is yours for the asking.
   The agency's Tele-Tax system allows you to call a toll-free
telephone number and hear a tape-recorded message on nearly 140 tax
topics. They range from No. 155, ``Dependents,'' to No. 612, ``Tips
_ Withholding and Reporting.''
   The messages are available up to 16{ hours a day to those with
push-button tone telephones and during regular office hours to those
with dial or push-button pulse phones. The number to call in your
area may be found on Page 50 of your tax instruction package; the
list of Tele-Tax topics is on Page 51.
   If there are questions about your return that you want to ask
directly of an IRS employee, there are different telephone numbers
to call. They are listed on Page 49 of 1040A instructions and on
Page 52 of 1040 instructions.
   A caution about these calls: In the past there was a good chance
you would get the wrong answer to your question. The IRS vows to
improve its performance in this area, but the more specific your
question, the better chance you have of getting the correct answer.
   If you don't fully understand the answer you are given, don't
hang up until you are satisfied. After all, it is your tax return
and you are responsible for filling it out correctly.

   More than half of America's taxpayers _ 60 percent of the 107
million _ will be hiring professional tax preparers this year,
according to an article in Lear's magazine.
   The number compares to 40 or 45 percent who sought professional
help on their taxes last year, says Lear's, a year-old magazine
aimed at women over 40.
   The article, written by Lisa Collier Cool, author of three
business books and a regular magazine contributor on financial
affairs, offers these alternatives for those seeking tax preparation
help:
   _ For those with relatively simple tax returns, there is free
tax-preparation assistance available from the Internal Revenue
Service.
   ``Of course, even when IRS employees provide correct information,
they aren't likely to volunteer strategies to reduce a tax bill,''
writes Ms. Cool. ``But if an agent who helps with a return makes
mistakes, the taxpayer isn't charged interest fees or penalties.''
   _ Least expensive tax help is available from uncertified public
accountants and franchised storefront services.
   They are also the least accurate, according to the IRS, says
Lear's.
   _ Certified public accountants and enrolled agents _ tax
preparers certified by the IRS _ can represent taxpayers at audits
and in tax court.
   ``Because of their high level of professional training,'' says
Lear's, ``CPAs and enrolled agents, who generally charge from $50 to
$100 an hour, can and will do more than merely fill in the blanks on
a 1040 form.'' Many will offer ideas on tax planning, tips on
keeping records and advice on deductions to be aware of throughout
the year.
   _ Tax attorneys generally deal with high-income earners whose
financial affairs are more complicated than most; their fees range
from $80 to $350 an hour.

   The Japanese parliament has voted a controversial
tax reform package into law, paving the way for the first overhaul
of the nation's postwar tax system.
   The package introduces a 3 percent sales tax and cuts corporate
and upper-level income taxes, but the tax burden of lower-income
families is expected to increase.
   Strong public and political opposition stopped several previous
tax reform attempts in the past 10 years.
   The measures constitute the first major overhaul of the tax
system drafted by U.S. occupation authorities after Japan's World
War II defeat.

   Federal regulators rescued a post-Depression
record 217 savings institutions in 1988, leaving Congress and
President-elect Bush to figure out the best way to pay the $38
billion bill.
   Theoretically, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates
the S&amp;L industry, expects enough income over the next 30 years _ $45
billion to $50 billion _ to cover the cost.
   But analysts and many members of Congress say regulators have run
up such a huge bill that turning to the taxpayer is inevitable.

<HEAD>Government Looks at Possible Bid for British Electronics Giant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today that it was looking at a
possible bid for the electronics giant General Electric Co. PLC that
an international consortium is expected to launch within days.
   The takeover, which analysts say could be worth between $11.5
billion and $14.2 billion, would be the largest in Britain.
   The consortium is expected to include Plessey PLC, another
electronics company which is the target of a $3 billion hostile
takeover bid from GEC and Siemens AG of West Germany, another
electronics company.
   Although no bid for GEC has been formally launched, the Office of
Fair Trading has legal powers to look at a bid ``in contemplation.''
   ``We really are looking at the situation to see who the
participants are involved before we can take real active steps,''
said a spokesman for the office, who asked not to be identified.
``There hasn't actually been a statement of intention.''
   The Office of Fair Trading usually reviews a bid and then makes a
recommendation to the trade secretary on whether he should refer it
to the monopolies commission for a full investigation.
   The bid speculation prompted heavy trading in GEC on London's
Stock Exchange by midday Monday.
   A GEC spokesman, who wasn't identified in accordance with British
practice, called the developments vague and inconclusive but said
that a takeover would be fought.
   ``This appears to be a self-interested attempt by the board of
Plessey and its advisers to form a consortium to break up GEC and
therefore save Plessey,'' he said.
   The possible bid for GEC began to be taken seriously after the
investment firm Lazard Brothers and Co. said over the weekend that
it had helped form a company called Metsun Ltd. to devise a proposal
``which may or may not'' lead to an offer for GEC.
   Metsun is headed by Sir John Cuckney, chairman of helicopter
maker Westland PLC, which was at the center of a 1986 takeover
controversy that prompted the resignation of two British Cabinet
ministers.
   Metsun was talking to possible partners both in Britain and
abroad, Lazard Brothers said, without identifying them.
   French electronics company Thomson-CSF said it was considering
joining the consortium.
   Meanwhile, Barclays Bank PLC confirmed it was putting together a
$6.2 billion syndicated loan to help finance such a bid.
   GEC Managing Director Lord Weinstock said in a television
interview that his company dropped Barclays Bank as one of its banks
because the bank had ``behaved in a way that was not quite right.''
   In addition, Lord Prior, GEC's chairman, resigned Saturday from
the board of Barclays Bank.
   Potential foreign interest in such an important British
manufaturing company is a sensitive political issue, particularly
following the controversy surrounding Westland.
   American helicopter maker Sikorsky Aircraft acquisition of a
stake in Westland, Britain's only helicopter builder, over rival
European bidders created the government controversy in 1986.
   Michael Heseltine, who resigned as defense secretary in
opposition to the American bid for Westland, was spearheading
demands Monday for Trade Secretary Lord Young to refer the GEC
matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission ``without delay.''
   The opposition Labor Party has said it will raise the issue in
the House of Commons ``as a matter of the utmost urgency'' when
members of Parliament return from the Christmas recess on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan today sent Congress a $1.15
trillion farewell budget that attacked his biggest economic failure,
the federal deficit, by offering up again some of his cherished
ideas about reducing the size of government.
   The president's ninth and final spending plan _ out of balance
like all of his others _ is largely an academic exercise, certain to
be overhauled to reflect the priorities of a Democratic-controlled
Congress and an incoming president, George Bush, after his
inauguration Jan. 20.
   Bush aides said that the president-elect agreed with the general
thrust of the Reagan document, especially the absence of any new
taxes, but still intended to submit his own recommendations after
taking office.
   If Reagan's ideas were adopted in their entirety, the deficit
would fall to $92.5 billion in the 1990 fiscal year, the lowest
since 1981 when he took office.
   ``This budget shows that a gradual elimination of the deficit is
possible without raising taxes,'' Reagan said in his budget message.
``It can be done in a reasonable, responsible way _ with discipline
and fairness. New taxes are not required.''
   In his proposals for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, 1989,
Reagan advocated terminating a total of 82 government programs,
slashing spending on farm programs by $9.7 billion and trimming the
growth in Medicare and Medicaid, the giant health programs, by about
$5 billion. The Pentagon's budget, on the other hand, was awarded a
big spending increase.
   The budget would provide increased spending for two of the
government's most pressing new problems, bailing out hundreds of
insolvent savings and loan institutions and cleaning up contaminated
nuclear weapons plants. AIDS research and space exploration would
also receive increases.
   While Reagan was presenting his budget only 11 days before
leaving office, many of its broad outlines were expected to be
adopted by Bush, who has said he will unveil his own proposals to a
special joint session of Congress soon after taking office.
   In two key respects, the two budgets will be alike. Both men
pledged to cut the deficit, which is projected to climb this year to
$161.5 billion, without resorting to new taxes and without touching
Social Security.
   But Bush is expected to seek a smaller increase in defense
spending while allocating more money in such areas as child care,
cleaning up the environment and housing the homeless.
   Skeptical Democrats believe Bush will find it impossible to
fulfill all his campaign promises for higher spending while relying
on a ``flexible freeze'' on other government programs to eliminate
the budget deficit without resorting to new taxes.
   ``President Reagan's final budget is really irrelevant at this
point,'' Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., former chairman of the House
Budget Committee, said today on ``CBS This Morning.'' ``It is a
farewell gesture that every president is required to do. It only
becomes relevant if George Bush today, tomorrow or this week says,
`that's my budget.' I don't expect him to do that.'' Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called Reagan's proposal ``amiable
fiction.''
   Reagan will leave office with a budget that proposes collecting
$1.059 trillion in revenues and spending $1.152 trillion, leaving a
budget deficit of $92.5 billion.
   The deficit, if realized, would be the lowest since a $73.7
billion imbalance between spending and revenues in 1981, the year
Reagan took office with a pledge to balance the budget by 1984.
Reagan saw that promise swamped by a tide of red ink which has
almost tripled the national debt.
   In his budget message, Reagan blamed the huge deficits on the
severe 1981-82 recession, which reduced government revenues, and on
the refusal of Congress to go along with his spending cuts. But he
predicted that the deficit could be totally eliminated by 1993 if
Congress adopts his spending cuts. Similar predictions of future
budget deficits in past Reagan budgets have proved to be wildly
optimistic, however.
   ``We have an opportunity this year to put the worst of the
deficit problem behind us and enable the next administration to
begin its term of office with a clean slate,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan's $92.5 billion deficit target for 1990 would be well
within the Gramm-Rudman requirement which sets a $100 billion
deficit goal for 1990. This law establishes declining deficit
targets leading to a balanced budget in 1993, holding out the threat
of across-the-board spending cuts if the targets are not met.
   Many private economists believe Reagan's 1990 deficit estimate is
based on overly optimistic assessments about how the economy will
perform, including expectations that growth will continue at a rapid
clip while inflation and interest rates both decline.
   Among the 82 individual programs recommended for termination by
Reagan are the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Legal Services
Corporation, the Economic Development Administration, the
Appalachian Regional Commission, direct loans by the Small Business
Administration, Amtrak railroad passenger subsidies, mass transit
grants and subsidies to airlines serving small airports.
   Reagan has tried and failed over the years to get Congress to go
along with these proposals.
   The president's final budget protects his defense buildup, one of
the hallmarks of his presidency, by proposing a 5.4 percent increase
to $315.2 billion in spending authority, 2 percent higher than the
expected rate of inflation. As part of the increase, the budget
seeks a 44 percent increase in spending authority for development of
the spaced-based Star Wars nuclear defense shield.
   Spending authority reflects not only the checks that will be
written in a given year but also authorization for outlays on
weapons systems that are begun in one year but paid for in future
years. Defense outlays for 1990 are projected at $303 billion,
compared to estimated outlays of $298.3 billion in 1989.
   The president also proposes making a downpayment of $900 million
to start cleaning up and modernizing the government's aging nuclear
weapons facilities, a project that the Energy Department estimates
could cost as much as $128 billion over the next two decades.
   Likewise, the budget projects spending $16 billion this year and
$9 billion next year to bail out hundreds of insolvent savings and
loan institutions. From 1988 through 1994, Reagan's budget estimates
spending to mop up the S&amp;L mess will exceed $80 billion but leaves
the problem of finding the necessary funds to the incoming Bush
administration.
   In the area of cuts, Reagan's budget proposed trimming the huge
Medicare program, which provides health care to Social Security
recipients, by $3.2 billion below the projected increase for 1990,
primarily by reducing the fees received by doctors and hospitals.
   Medicaid, which pays the health bills of poor people, would be
cut by $1.7 billion over its projected increase for 1990 with the
savings coming from reductions in federal payments to the states,
which run the Medicaid program.

   The Supreme Court today refused to let the
government permit Japanese salmon fishermen off the Alaska coast
from using huge nets in which porpoise and other marine mammals get
trapped.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling that blocked such fishing.
   At issue is an interpretation of a federal law, the Marine Mammal
Protection Act of 1972, which spells out how marine mammals may be
``taken'' _ hunted, captured or killed _ in U.S. waters.
   The law generally bans all such takings of marine mammals but
contains an exception allowing the secretary of commerce to
authorize specified takings incidental to commercial fishing.
   The secretary, however, may not allow incidental takings of any
marine mammal species in danger of significant depletion or
extinction.
   The United States requires fishing permits within a 200-mile
protected zone.
   In 1986, the Federation of Japan Salmon Fisheries Cooperative
Associations sought to extend a permit under which it would be
entitled to snare up to 5,500 Dall's porpoise a year in salmon
gillnets cast in the waters of the north Pacific Ocean and the
Bering Sea.
   Other sea mammals such as Northern fur seals and sea lions also
become snarled in the nets, some of which are nine miles long.
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity issued a general permit for
the Japanese fishermen to operate after finding that the Dall's
porpoise population would not be threatened.
   He could not make such a determination, however, for the Northern
fur seal or Northern sea lion populations.
   Environmental and Native Alaskan groups challenged the legality
of granting a permit to the Japanese fishermen.
   A federal trial judge blocked the fishing operations during the
salmon season last June and July. The judge said the government
could not assure that some marine mammals surely to be caught in the
nets are not in danger of depletion or extinction.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here upheld the injunction by a
2-1 vote, and the Supreme Court rejected the Reagan adminstration's
emergency challenge of that ruling last June 9.
   In the appeal acted on today, Justice Department lawyers argued
that the practical effect of the appeals court's Feb. 16 ruling
``would be to shut down large segments of commercial fishing by both
domestic and foreign entities in U.S. waters.''
   But lawyers for the environmental and Native Alaskan groups urged
the justices to reject the appeal.
   Lawyers for the Center for Environmental Education contended that
Marine Mammal Protection Act amendments enacted last November
indicate that Congress agreed with the appeals court's
interpretation of the law.
   ``Congress ... intentionally drafted the (amendments) so as to
exclude the Japanese driftnet fleet and reauthorized the
prohibitions in the (act) in their existing form,'' they argued.
   The case is Verity vs. Center for Environmental Education, 88-428.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Lower On Cancelled Exports, Brazilian Rain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly
lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade in response to the
cancellation of some U.S. export business and to weekend showers in
the South American soybean belt.
   The Agriculture Department said late Friday that private
exporters had reported cancellations of sales of 240,000 metric tons
of U.S. soybeans for delivery to unknown destinations. Analysts said
the most likely buyer was the Soviet Union, which occasionally is
forced to cancel grain purchases due to limited port space.
   Unexpectedly heavy weekend showers in one of Brazil's most
important soybean growing regions also contributed to the early
selling of soybean futures, analysts said.
   But the weekend was drier in Argentina, a large producer of
soybeans, wheat and corn, which helped limit losses on the U.S.
futures markets, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   ``Argentina is a much bigger exporter of wheat and corn than
Brazil,'' he said.
   Cautious trading is expected this week ahead of Friday's USDA
crop report.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 2{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.46\ a bushel; corn was \ cent
to 1 cent lower with March at $2.88} a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to
2 cents lower with March at $2.41 a bushel; soybeans were 1\ cents
to 3} cents lower with January at $8.15 a bushel.
   Livestock futures were higher while frozen pork-belly futures
were mixed in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .03 cent to .30 cent higher with February at
73.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .20 cent higher
with January at 84.50 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .58
cent higher with February at 47.35 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .22 cent lower to .45 cent higher with February at
44.35 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures closed mixed on Friday.

<HEAD>Justices Bar Caboose Requirement by Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today barred Texas officials
from requiring cabooses or alternative safety equipment on most
trains traveling through the state.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that federal law
preempts such state regulation.
   The Texas Railroad Commission in 1986 adopted a rule requiring
cabooses capable of communicating with the locomotive on all trains
carrying various hazardous materials and on trains more than 2,000
feet long that lack mechanical devices for monitoring the train and
track.
   The regulation was designed to allow someone in the caboose to
make sure brakes, axles and wheels are not overheating and to check
for any problems behind the train.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the rule last
July. The appeals court, noting the safety aspects of cabooses
generally have been supplanted by technological advances, said the
Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 preempts the state's regulation.
   Cabooses once were essential to train operation in the days when
brakes were located there, the appeals court said.
   But now, it said, ``Automatic brakes are controlled from the
locomotive, advances in wheel bearings decrease the risk of
overheating and monitoring devices simulate rear-car observation.''
   Major railroads, through collective bargaining with their unions,
in 1982 eliminated cabooses from about one-fourth of all trains.
   The 5th Circuit court said Congress, in passing the Federal
Railroad Safety Act, determined that cabooses do not involve safety.
The issue is one for collective bargaining, the appeals court said.
   ``Under these circumstances, we are compelled to conclude that
the (act) has impliedly preempted state regulation of cabooses,''
the appeals court said. Requiring cabooses in some states would
burden interstate commerce by forcing the railroads to attach
cabooses at all times or stop at state borders where they are
required to attach them, the appeals court said.
   Texas regulation permits railroads to avoid the need for cabooses
by installing load and overheating detectors and other devices along
the track.
   But the appeals court said the requirement for those devices is
preempted by federal law as well.
   The Texas Railroad Commission said the 5th Circuit court ruling
permits ``collective bargaining to override governmental regulation
of a safety issue.''
   The case is Railroad Commission of Texas vs. Missouri Pacific,
88-789.

some resistance at its highest levels in nearly 15 months.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 25.72 points
last week, gained another 1.07 to 2,195.36 by noontime today on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 681 up, 589 down and
562 unchanged.
   The market has benefited in recent sessions from buying by money
managers at investing institutions seeking to put some of their
large cash reserves to work at the start of a new year.
   But analysts said traders were worried that the rally had
encountered some large obstacles.
   Each time the Dow Jones industrial average reached the 2,000
level last week, selling pressure seemed to intensify.
   In addition, brokers noted, the advance in stock prices of late
has come without any help from interest rates. Yields on
interest-bearing investments, especially in the short-term money
market, remain a strong competitive threat to stocks.
   The Japanese stock market, meanwhile, advanced to a new high
today, surprising observers who had expected a decline following the
death of Emperor Hirohito.
   In the U.S. market, Pacific Resources jumped 4} to 18{. Broken
Hill Proprietary Co. of Australia reached an agreement to acquire
the company for $19 a share.
   Polaroid fell 2[ to 36[ after a court ruled in favor of the
company's employee stock ownership plan, dealing a setback to
Shamrock Holdings's hostile takeover bid for Polaroid.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.03 to 157.99. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.82 at 313.22.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 68.78 million shares at noontime,
down from 74.34 million at the same point Friday.

   For the second week in a row, the number of
working oil and natural gas rigs took a plunge, this week by 36 to
total 872, industry watcher Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   Last week the count plunged by 32 to total 908, following a
two-week increase of 25 rigs. A year ago, the number of rigs totaled
1,102, Baker Hughes said Monday.
   The decline follows normal seasonal patterns, according to Baker
Hughes economist Ike Kerridge.
   The count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity
and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of
last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   The lowest level last year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2.
   Among major oil producing states, Wyoming saw the steepest
decline with 10 fewer rigs, followed by New Mexico, nine; Louisiana,
five; Kansas and Pennsylvania, four each; Michigan and Texas, three
each; and North Dakota, one.
   Oklahoma had the biggest gain with six additional rigs, followed
by California and Colorado with three each and Ohio had one.

<HEAD>Talks with Machinists Break Off, Eastern Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federally mediated talks between Eastern Airlines
and its largest union apparently broke off today, the company said.
   ``I confirm that at this point (negotiations halted),'' Eastern
spokesman Robin Matell said. ``Right now we are assessing what is
happening.
   ``I don't want to give any positions at this point,'' Matell
added. ``We would reserve our comment.''
   Machinists District 100 President Charles E. Bryan wasn't
immediately available for comment today, nor were National Mediation
Board Chairman Walter Wallace and mediator Harry Bickford, who was
joined by Wallace for talks beginning last Friday at the Sheraton
Hotel in Key Largo, Fla.
   The Eastern-Machinists negotiations went into federal mediation
nearly one year ago after direct negotiations stalemated. Wallace
joined Bickford in an effort to get the talks moving, but sources
speaking on condition of anonymity said there had been virtually no
progress during the lengthy weekend sessions.
   Eastern has been pressing for federal declaration of an impasse,
which would begin a 30-day cooling-off period. After the 30 days,
the union could strike and the company could impose its own work
conditions.
   Eastern says only the pressure of a deadline, which the mediators
have refused to set, will get the negotiations moving. The union has
claimed Eastern wants to provoke a strike so it can try to break it
and bust the union.
   Eastern put out a bulletin to its employees Sunday reporting that
the Machinists' lead negotiator had walked out. William Scheri, the
national Machinists' union airline chief negotiator, had
participated for the first time in the Eastern mediation last
weekend, but left Key Largo on Sunday.
   ``Mr. Scheri's sudden departure after the Wallace announcement of
`no deadline' for these talks reinforces our previously stated
belief that the IAM will not take the talks seriously until the NMB
starts the 30-day cooling off period,'' the company bulletin said.
   However, the mediators said they had been informed earlier that
Scheri planned to participate only through the weekend before
returning to Washington headquarters of the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
   The two sides, who last met in intense mediation in July, have
been some $200 million apart. The Machinists, representing 8,500
mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground service workers, or
more than one-fourth of Eastern's employees, were seeking a $50
million raise.
   Eastern was seeking $150 million in concessions, mostly from the
non-mechanics.
   Eastern, which reported $233.7 million in losses for the first
three quarters of 1988, has lobbied vigorously for declaration of an
impasse.

<HEAD>Motion Picture Chief Sees Alliance with VCR Industry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief spokesman for the motion picture
industry has called for an alliance with the VCR industry _ once
considered a dreaded rival _ in the battle against film pirating.
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, told attendees at the Consumer Electronics Show that the
videocassette recorder industry was viewed as a virus by his
industry as movie attendance waned in the 1970s.
   A strange thing has happened since 1971, when the electronics
industry and the movies declared war on each other, Valenti said.
   ``The trend is that the more a person watches a movie on a VCR,
the more that person seems to be drawn to wanting to see a movie in
a theater,'' Valenti said Sunday.
   ``There is a rise in movie attendance by those 40 years and
older,'' he said. ``There is a yearning to be entertained.''
   That yearning is worldwide, Valenti said.
   ``There is now a celebration going on for both the electronics
and movie industries,'' Valenti said.
   A rapport and attitude of ``cooperative collaboration'' has
developed ``between your industry and mine,'' Valenti told the
electronics executives.
   Valenti called for the electronics industry to join in the battle
against film piracy and illegal copying.
   ``Systems must be made copy-proof,'' Valenti said. ``I ask for
your commitment to that in the future.''
   Film piracy and illegal copying is a hot topic annually at the
Consumer Electronics Show, which showcases a wide array of
electronic gadgetry from VCRs to television, telephones, home office
equipment, camcorders and other audio-video equipment.
   Valenti said the future is promising for both the electronics and
motion picture industries.
   The electronics industry has the technical skills to make the
machines that can carry the creative stories produced on film by the
motion picture industry, Valenti said.

   Speculation that an international consortium could
soon launch a hostile takeover bid for Britain's General Electric
Co. PLC gave a strong boost to share prices Monday on the London
Stock Exchange.
   The potential bid, estimated at around 7 billion British pounds,
or about $12.4 billion, would be the largest takeover ever seen on
the London exchange.
   The bid speculation gained force over the weekend when Lazard
Brothers and Co. revealed a company had been formed to devise a
proposal ``which may or may not'' lead to an offer for GEC. Widely
assumed to be part of an eventual bidding group is electronics giant
Plessey Co., itself the target of a 1.7 billion pound ($3 billion)
bid from GEC and West Germany's Siemens AG.
   At the close of trading, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 20.2 points, or 1.1 percent, at 1,831.5.
   The index began the day with a gain of 15.2 points, its minimum
level, before rising as much as 24.7 points by around midday.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed with a gain of 20.7
points at 1,502.0. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 11.31
points to close at 1,031.20.
   Volume picked up strongly, as a brisk 589.7 million shares
changed hands, although turnover was concentrated in a handful of
selected stocks. The figure was up from volume of 459.5 million
shares on Friday.
   GEC shares jumped 19 pence (34 cents) to finish at 221 pence
($3.91) in heavy trading. Plessey shares were down 2 pence (4 cents)
at 226 pence ($4) at the close.

<HEAD>Stocks Leap In Tokyo After Hirohito's Death</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices posted their biggest gain in a year and
the Nikkei Stock Average set a record on Monday, the first day of
trading since Emperor Hirohito's death of cancer on Saturday.
   Analysts said small investors, who had held back from the market
out of anxiety during Hirohito's long illness, flooded the Tokyo
Stock Exchange with buy orders.
   ``The opening of a new era is having a (positive) psychologicaleconomy,''
said Christopher Chew, strategist for James
Capel Pacific Ltd. ``Markets have been discounting for the emperor's
death since mid-Oc
impact on the tober, when it became clear he wasn't going to
recover,'' he said.
   Most businesses returned to normal on Monday after having closed
for mourning over the weekend. Department stores had turned off
their blazing neon signs and draped window displays with white
sheets.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange canceled its regular Saturday half-day's
trading and asked members to exercise restraint in their business
activities this week _ reflecting a view that it would be unseemly
for trading to be active.
   But trading on Monday was extremely active, with 1.1 billion
shares changing hands. Analysts said the trading was by individual
investors. Major securities firms limited their trading out of
consideration for the nationa economist at the Mitsubishi Research Institute,
a private
think tank.
   ``From now on, the impact (of Hirohito's death) will be
positive,'' Yano said.
   Shortly after Hirohito became bedridden on Sept. 19, hotels,
caterers, florists and suppliers of food and formal wear reported
falling sales due to cancellations of weddings and parties.
   One executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
cancellation of just one order for a gala autumn festival cost his
firm more than $70,000.
   Richard Jerram, an economist at the Kleinwort Benson brokerage in
Tokyo, estimated that the slackness caused by Hirohito's long
illness could have reduced Japan's growth for the period by
one-quarter of a percentage point.
   Hirohito's death did not provoke anything like last September's
cancellations, despite an official six-day period of mourning and a
yearlong mourning period for the imperial family.
   Saturday was not a propitious day according to the Buddhist
calendar often used in Japan to select wedding dates, and on Sunday
such functions went ahead as planned.
   ``There has been absolutely no impact on reservations for our
facilities for weddings and other events,'' said a managerial
employee at the Imperial Hotel, who refused to give her name.
   ``It was fortuitous that his death fell on a Saturday so that
there was a minimum of economic disruption,'' Jerram said. ``Now
it's business as usual.''
   Monday's big gains on the stock exchange contrasted sharply with
the plunge of 352.42 points in the Nikkei average to 27,548.58 on
Sept. 20, the day after Hirohito became seriously ill.
   Since then, the index has climbed past 30,000 points despite
rumors about Hirohito's illness that occasionally shook the market.
   Economists predict unusually high demand for printing products as
Japan shifts from the old Showa calendar of Hirohito's reign to the
Heisei calendar of the new emperor.
   Prices of printing, paper and pulp and ink shares did not shoot
up. Any increases would have occurred long ago as it became apparent
that Hirohito was going to die.

<TEXT>
   British electronics giant General Electric Co. PLC
on Monday accused rival Plessey Co. of mounting ``a spoiling
tactic'' by joining an international consortium that is expected to
make a hostile bid for GEC.
   GEC had joined Siemens AG of West Germany in launching a hostile,
$3 billion offer for Plessey in November. Now GEC finds itself the
target of a possible counter-bid by a consortium that probably will
include Plessey.
   GEC said it would fight the possible counter-bid and pursue its
efforts with Siemens to take over Plessey.
   Britain's GEC and U.S.-based General Electric Co. are not related.
   The government's Office of Fair Trading said it was studying the
possible bid for GEC, which is expected to be launched by a new
international consortium within days.
   That takeover could be worth between $11.5 billion and $14.2
billion, Britain's largest ever.
   A counter-bid is known on Wall Street as the Pac Man takeover
defense because of its similarity to the eat-or-be-eaten video game.
   The possibility of GEC being taken over sparked political
controversy at the prospect of a large defense-oriented company
falling under foreign control.
   Three years ago, two Cabinet ministers resigned in a controversy
over foreign bids for Britain's only helicopter maker, Westland PLC.
   GEC said a weekend statement from the investment firm Lazard
Brothers &amp; Co. about a possible takeover bid for GEC was ``vague and
inconclusive.''
   A GEC spokesman told Press Association, the domestic news agency:
``This appears to be a self-interested attempt by the board of
Plessey and its advisers to form a consortium to break up GEC and
therefore save Plessey, in the short term, regardless of the cost to
British industry in terms of lost opportunities and lost jobs.''
   The spokesman said it was a ``spoiling tactic'' by Plessey that
would be fought.
   GEC Managing Director Lord Weinstock said in a Sunday television
interview that GEC would pursue its bid for Plessey.
   A GEC spokesman declined to comment to The Associated Press.
Plessey also had no comment, a spokesman told the AP.
   GEC shares jumped 19 pence (34 cents) to finish at 221 pence
($3.91) in heavy trading on London's Stock Exchange Monday. Plessey
shares were down 2 pence (4 cents) at 226 pence ($4) at the close.
   The possible bid for GEC began to look serious after Lazard
Brothers said it had helped form a company called Metsun Ltd. to
devise a proposal ``which may or may not'' lead to an offer for GEC.
   Metsun is headed by Sir John Cuckney, Westland's chairman.
   Metsun was talking to possible international partners, Lazard
Brothers said, without identifying them. British news reports said
possible participants might include Thomson-CSF of France, American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and General Electric of the United States.
   Meanwhile, Barclays Bank PLC confirmed it was putting together a
$6.2 billion syndicated loan to help finance such a bid.
   The Office of Fair Trading said it was looking at the possible
bid, noting that it has legal powers to review a bid ``in
contemplation.''
   A spokesman who requested anonymity said the office was examining
which participants were involved, adding: ``There hasn't actually
been a statement of intention.''
   The Office of Fair Trading usually reviews a bid and then makes a
recommendation to the trade secretary on whether to refer it to the
monopolies commission for full investigation.
   Rhe acquisition of a stake in Westland by United Technologies
Corp.'s Sikorsky division over rival European bidders plunged the
government into controversy in 1986.
   Michael Heseltine, who resigned as defense secretary in
opposition to the American bid for Westland, spearheaded demands
from politicians and unions for Trade Secretary Lord Young to refer
the GEC matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission ``without
delay.''
   After the Office of Fair Trading made its statement, Heseltine
said: ``I believe the Government is to be congratulated on the speed
with which it has acted to give a proper appraisal of the strategic
and industrial implications of a breakup of GEC.''
   The opposition Labor Party says it will raise the issue in the
House of Commons ``as a matter of the utmost urgency'' when
lawmakers return from the Christmas recess on Tuesday.
   GEC, which employs more than 100,000 people, had pre-tax profit
of $1.2 billion on sales of $9.8 billion in its most recent year.

<HEAD>High Court Refuses To Revive Bendectin Lawsuits Against Dow Chemical</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a major victory for Dow Chemical Co., the
Supreme Court on Monday upheld a lower court ruling dismissing
hundreds of personal injury lawsuits tied to the chemical giant's
anti-nausea drug Bendectin.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by more than 800
families who filed a federal lawsuit against Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals, the Cincinnati-based Dow unit that manufactures the
drug.
   Meanwhile Monday, the justices agreed to decide whether Congress
may outlaw all sexually explicit telephone dial-up message services,
known as dial-a-porn. The high court will rule on the validity of a
1988 law that sought to ban all obscene and indecent messages
available through these services.
   A federal judge in California ruled last summer that the law
could be applied to ban all obscene messages, but he struck down the
law's ban on messages deemed merely indecent.
   The court also made several decisions effecting state and local
governments, including one that bars cities and towns from receiving
$180 million in federal revenue-sharing funds withheld by the Reagan
administration. In the case involving the Dow Chemical subsidiary,
the justices refused to revive lawsuits seeking millions of dollars
in damages on behalf of children with birth defects allegedly caused
by their mothers' use of Bendectin during pregnancy.
   Merrell Dow had agreed in a 1984 settlement to create a $120
million fund to compensate these children, although it did not admit
the drug had caused the defects.
   The settlement later was rejected by a federal appeals court,
which reinstated the suits against Merrell Dow. A federal jury
decided after a 22-day trial in 1985 that Bendectin did not cause
birth defects when taken in prescribed doses.
   That ruling was appealed, and last August it was upheld by the
6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Merrell Dow spokesman William Donaldson said his company was
``pleased with the U.S. Supreme Court's denial of a hearing since
this case is the major case involving Bendectin.'' The company
maintains the drug is safe.
   In other business-related action Monday, the Supreme Court:
   _Left intact a ruling that $180 million in federal
revenue-sharing funds properly was withheld from local governments
under budget cuts imposed by the so-called Gramm-Rudman Act.
   _Agreed to decide whether federal courts should referee some
disputes over electric power rates between public utilities and
local or state regulatory agencies.
   _Refused to bar city-owned water systems from charging some
non-resident customers higher rates than other non-residents even if
there is no cost-related reason.
   _Agreed to decide whether states generally are immune from being
sued for money damages by bankruptcy trustees.
   _Refused to let the government permit Japanese salmon fishermen
off the Alaska coast to use huge nets in which porpoise and other
marine mammals get trapped.
   _Agreed to decide whether the Justice Department must supply a
weekly tax magazine with copies of all federal trial court opinions
and orders in tax cases.
   _Decided to use a dispute over royalties from aerosol valves to
answer a question involving the authority of federal appeals courts.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Fall On Argentine Rain Forecasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed sharply lower Monday
on the Chicago Board of Trade on forecasts for rain in Argentina,
the world's fourth-largest soybean producer, where early growing
conditions have been dry.
   Wheat and corn futures finished mostly higher, although both of
those markets also were pressured late in the trading session by the
Argentine rain forecasts.
   The rain predictions followed a weekend of unexpectedly heavy
showers in Brazil, the world's second-largest soybean producer after
the United States.
   ``This morning the forecasters were saying Argentina would be
relatively dry but later on they started saying there would be more
rain in the next 24 hours in Argentina than was previously
expected,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Further selling of soybean futures was prompted by the
Agriculture Department's announcement late Friday that private
exporters had reported cancellations of sales of 240,000 metric tons
of U.S. soybeans for delivery to unknown destinations.
   ``Everybody assumes it was the Soviet Union that canceled it,''
Lespinasse said.
   At the close of trading, wheat was unchanged to 1{ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in March at $4.48} a bushel; corn was
1} cents lower to { cent higher with March at $2.89\ a bushel; oats
were 3\ cents to 4 cents lower with March at $2.39 a bushel;
soybeans were 2 cents to 12 cents lower with January at $8.06 a
bushel.

<HEAD>High Court to Apply Dispute over Royalties to Court Question</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday said it will use a
dispute over royalties from aerosol valves to answer a question
involving the authority of federal appeals courts.
   The court agreed to hear an appeal by an Illinois corporation
that sued four Venezuelans and a U.S. citizen living in Venezuela.
   The company, Newman-Green Inc., has been making aerosol valves
for more than 30 years. It arranged in the early 1970s to market the
valves in Venezuela and set up a licensing agreement with five
shareholders of the venture in the South American country.
   Newman-Green filed a suit in federal court in Illinois in 1982,
accusing the five of violating the royalty agreement.
   The five include William L. Bettison, a U.S. citizen who lives in
Venezuela.
   A federal judge awarded Newman-Green $200,000 in unpaid royalties
but said the Venezuelan shareholders did not owe royalties for a
period after the U.S. company canceled its license with the
Venezuelan shareholders.
   Newman-Green asked a three-judge panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for increased royalties.
   The panel then noticed that the federal courts appeared to lack
authority over the dispute because of the presence of Bettison as a
defendant.
   Federal courts have jurisdiction in such disputes when the
opposing sides are from different states or from different nations.
Bettison's lack of residency in the United States, while still a
U.S. citizen, jeopardized federal court jurisdiction, the panel said.
   But the panel said the problem was solved by eliminating Bettison
as a defendant. It then ruled that Newman-Green is entitled to
additional royalties from the other four.
   That decision was overturned last August by the full 7th Circuit
court in an 8-3 ruling.
   The full appeals court said the three-judge panel lacked the
authority to dismiss Bettison from the case and sent the dispute
back to the federal judge who presided originally over the suit.
   The appeals court said the judge must decide the next step, which
could be to dismiss Bettison as a defendant.
   ``We can find no source for a power in a court of appeals to
preserve ... jurisdiction by dismissing a ... party retroactively to
the date the suit was filed,'' the full 7th Circuit court said.
   Newman-Green appealed to the Supreme Court to reinstate the
ruling by the three-judge panel.
   The case is Newman-Green vs. Alfonzo-Larrain, 88-774.

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration on Monday dumped the
savings and loan crisis into the lap of President-elect Bush,
acknowledging for the first time it does not have enough money to
bail out the troubled industry.
   The administration, in its proposed budget for fiscal year 1990,
outlined plans to spend $64 billion from the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corp., from 1989 through 1994. Of that, $16 billion
would be spent in fiscal 1989, which began last Oct. 1; $9 billion
in 1990, and $39 billion from 1991 through 1994.
   But the budget document acknowledged ``these proposals will not
resolve the entire problem.'' It said Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady is working on a plan, ``including identifying additional
funding sources for FSLIC,'' to be presented to Bush within 60 days.
   The budget shows spending of $64 billion over six years, but
projects collections by the FSLIC of only $33.4 billion. That does
not necessarily mean, however, the $30.6 billion difference will
have to be made up with tax dollars immediately.
   The insurance fund, which guarantees deposit accounts up to
$100,000, can continue, as it has over the past year, to spend in
the form of promissory notes to bailed-out institutions.
   The notes count as immediate spending for budget purposes but,
until they come due sometimes 10 years later, the agency spends only
enough cash to cover the interest.
   Another kind of commitment from S&amp;L regulators _ promises to make
good on some of the future losses of rescued institutions _ do not
show up on the budget at all until the cash is actually spent.
   In calendar year 1988, S&amp;L regulators spent, or promised to
spend, more than $38 billion to rescue a post-Depression record 217
insolvent savings and loans. However, that still leaves a large
problem _ about 350 insolvent institutions and another 150 with
capital levels close to insolvency.
   The Reagan budget document maintains that of the $25 billion in
projected spending for 1989 and 1990, $10 billion in 1989 and $5
billion in 1990 will be for ``new case resolutions'' and the rest to
pay for old rescue deals.
   However, Reagan budget director, Joseph R. Wright Jr.,
acknowledged most of the $10 billion for new deals in 1989 was
alreadly spent in the first three months of the fiscal year.
   ``Our point is this should allow the FSLIC to handle the most
troubled institutions. ... It's not like this is the final
solution,'' Wright said. Any additional money should be linked to
reforms of the regulatory system, he said.
   ``If you just pour money into it and leave the industry operating
the way it is now, you can find yourself pouring it in again in
eight to 10 years,'' he warned.
   An official of the General Accounting Office, the auditing wing
of Congress, said regulators appear to have already committed
themselves to spending all of their projected revenue for the next
decade.
   ``Based on what I've seen, I think they've spent it all, or maybe
even more than they can count on receiving over the next 10 years,''
said Craig Simmons, a GA analyst.
   According to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the FSLIC's parent
agency, the insurance fund will collect about $2.2 billion a year in
assessments from member S&amp;Ls.
   Under legislation passed by Congress in 1987, it has authority to
sell bonds to raise another $5.5 billion this year and next. Plus,
over the next five years, it expects to realize $9 billion from the
sale of property previously owned by insolvent S&amp;Ls.
   The GAO is analyzing the FSLIC's finances to determine whether it
faces a cash crunch in the future. By the end of 1990, the bank
board will have issued $10.6 billion in bonds and, to date, it has
issued about $25 billion in promissory notes. The interest on those
obligations will run at least $3 billion a year.
   Bert Ely, a financial analyst in Alexandria, Va., said, ``I think
they're facing a cash crunch this year.''
   The Treasury Department, according to administration sources who
declined to be identified, is studying a number of options f money into
the insurance fund.
   One plan would raise the money through additional borrowing.
Taxpayers would pay the interest, but the money would be borrowed
``off-budget'' and would not add to the federal budget deficit. An
independent board, incor
pumping moreluding the Treasury secretary, would oversee
regulators' spending of the new money.
   The Reagan budget document, while withholding details of the
Treasury plan, outlined its principles:
   _Insured depositors will be protected.
   _``Private resources,'' including additional money from the S&amp;L
industry, ``should be fully explored before any public assistance is
considered.''
   _Reform of the existing regulatory structure should be linked to
any additional money.
   _``There must be full accountability to the president and the
Congress'' for any use of additional money.
   _Reforms should aim at maintaining ``market forces and
discipline.'' The document did not explain precisely what was meant
by that phra
   Reagan called, too, for eliminating subsidies that help run
subways and bus services and terminating a program that keeps air
service for many small communities.
   Doctors would have to accept smaller fees for treating the
elderly under Medicare and the poor under Medicaid. Radiologists,
anesthesiologists and surgeons especially would get less.
   The nation's six million boat owners _ weekend sailors and
commercial fishermen alike _ would have to buy a $25 Coast Guard
decal to help defray the costs of rescues in emergencies.
   Homebuyers would see a nearly four-fold increase in the 1 percent
fee for VA loan guarantees. It would rise to 3.8 percent under
Reagan's proposals.
   He proposed eliminating the 1990 cost-of-living increase in
pensions received by federal retirees and reworking the formula
under which COLA increases are granted so that the retired workers
would have to absorb the first 1 percent increase in the annual cost
of living.
   Workers who lose their jobs to foreign competition now get weekly
benefits while they look for other work. Reagan proposed eliminating
a program which he said works ``to benefit one group of
underemployed workers or uncompetitive firms.''

   The stock market eked out a small gain today,
running into some resistance at its highest levels in nearly 15
months.
   The market has benefited in recent sessions from buying by money
managers at investing institutions seeking to put some of their
large cash reserves to work at the start of a new year.
   But analysts said traders were worried that the rally had
encountered some large obstacles.
   Each time the Dow Jones industrial average reached the 2,000
level last week, selling pressure seemed to intensify.
   In addition, brokers noted, the advance in stock prices of late
has come without any help from interest rates. Yields on
interest-bearing investments, especially in the short-term money
market, remain a strong competitive threat to stocks.
   The Japanese stock market, meanwhile, advanced to a new high
today, failing to fulfill forecasts of a decline following the death
of Emperor Hirohito.

   The stock market gained ground for the fourth
straight session Monday, getting a little more mileage out of its
early-1989 rally despite resistance from sellers.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.17 to 2,199.46, a
new high since the 1987 crash. Over the past four sessions the
average has climbed 54.82 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
880 up, 639 down and 469 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 163.18 million
shares, up from 161.33 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 191.09 million shares.

<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Wisconsin legislator wants a fast-food
chain to promote specials on cheeseburgers as well as hamburgers.
   State Rep. Mary Hubler, D-Rice Lake, said Monday in a letter to
Burger King officials that she was concerned the chain's Whoppers
and regular hamburgers were offered at reduced prices while a
Whopper with cheese and cheeseburgers went for the regular price.
   She said this is the ``second year in a row that Burger King has
run specials on only the Whopper and hamburgers.'' It costs only
about 2 cents to put a slice of cheese on a hamburger, she said.
   ``In the Dairy State, Burger King should be promoting their
sandwiches with cheese and taking an active role in the overall
promotion of the dairy industry,'' Ms. Hubler said.
   A Burger King official said his company does not discriminate
against cheese.
   ``We try to rotate the specials, and a number of them have
involved Whoppers and cheeseburgers,'' said Tim D. Thorpe, marketing
manager in Burger King's regional office in Minneapolis.
   ``Our franchisees in Wisconsin are well aware that they are in
the dairy state,'' Thorpe said.

<HEAD>State Officials Cautious About Sale of Pacific Resources</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials reacted cautiously Monday to the
announcement that Pacific Resources Inc., Hawaii's second-largest
publicly held company, has agreed to be bought by Australia's
largest company for nearly $400 million.
   Gov. John Waihee said the state will look closely at the
agreement for Pacific Resources to be merged with Broken Hill
Proprietary Co. Ltd.
   Broken Hill wants to combine its own petroleum exploration and
development business with the refining and marketing operations of
Pacific Resources. The Hawaii company would become its international
headquarters for marketing crude oil.
   The sale must be approved by regulatory agencies, including the
state Public Utilities Commission, and by holders of 75 percent of
Pacific Resources' shares.
   The two companies announced Sunday that their directors have
approved an agreement providing for the merger of Pacific Resources
with a wholly owned subsidiary of Broken Hill, but with Pacific
Resources maintaining its corporate identity.
   Under the agreement, Broken Hill will make a cash tender offer
for all of Pacific Resources' common stock at $19 a share. Pacific
Resources' common shares jumped nearly $5 on the news of the deal,
closing at $18.50 per share in consolidated New York Stock Exchange
trading, up from $13.75 Friday.
   The tender offer is expected to begin this week, with the
transaction completed during the first half of 1989, the companies
said.
   Pacific Resources is a Honolulu-based energy company with
subsidiaries and activities in Hawaii, on the mainland, in Australia
and in Asia. In Hawaii, it operates a refinery and owns the local
gas utility.
   For the first nine months of 1988, Pacific Resources reported
revenues of $674 million and net income of $30 million. It has
assets of $538 million.
   Broken Hill, which was incorporated in 1885, is involved in the
exploration and production of petroleum and minerals and in
steelmaking and related activities.
   In the fiscal year ending last May 31, Broken Hill reported
revenues of more than $9 billion and net income of $790 million.
   The announcement said the board of Alexander &amp; Baldwin Inc., a
Hawaii firm that owns 36 percent of Pacific Resources' common and
preferred shares, has agreed to sell them to Broken Hill at the same
prices being offered to other shareholders.
   Pacific Resources also has granted Broken Hill an option to buy
authorized but unissued common stock equivalent to about 18.5
percent of Pacific Resources' outstanding shares, it said.
   Exercising these two options would give Broken Hill 43 percent of
Pacific Resources' issued and outstanding common shares, the
announcement said.

<HEAD>Record Number Of Companies Changed Names In 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More U.S. companies changed their names in 1988
than at any time in the past 19 years, and more than half the
changes resulted from corporate mergers and takeovers, a
corporate-identity firm said Monday.
   The number of companies changing names last year was 1,864, or 6
percent more than the 1,753 that changed names in 1987, the previous
record year, said Anspach Grossman Portugal Inc., which has
conducted an annual survey of corporate name changes for 19 years.
   The number of new names resulting from mergers and acquisitions
last year was 961, or 52 percent of the total, according to the New
York- and San Francisco-based company.
   Among them were Standard Oil Co., whose name was changed to BP
America after its acquisition by British Petroleum Co. PLC; and
Firestone Tire and Rubber Co., whose name was shortened to Firestone
Corp. after the company's sale to Japan's Bridgestone Corp.
   An additional 430 name changes, or 23 percent of the total,
resulted from corporate downsizing, such as spinoffs and
divestitures. Among them were Allegis Corp., the parent company of
United Airlines, which changed its name back to UAL Corp. after
shedding its hotel and car-rental operations.
   Those companies changing their names for reasons other than
mergers or downsizings numbered 473, or 25 percent of the total.
Among theme were James B. Beam Distillers, which changed its name to
Jim Beam Brands Inc., and Deluxe Check Printers, to Deluxe Corp.
   ``Sometimes a company combines well-known names to take advantage
of the equity they have built up among customers,'' said Joel
Portugal, a principal in Anspach Grossman Portugal.
   ``For example, Dr Pepper and Seven-Up merged as Dr
Pepper-Seven-Up; Memorex acquired Telex and became Memorex-Telex;
and Fleet Financial and Norstar Bancorp merged into Fleet-Norstar
Financial.''
   Anspach Grossman Portugal said it compiles its list through
announcements of corporate name changes in newspapers, magazines,
trade publications and other sources. Portugal said there is no one
organization or government agency that keeps track of such changes,
and so his firm's list is an approximation of the actual number of
name changes.

   The dollar rose Monday but was knocked off its
highs of the day by the intervention of the central banks of the
United States, West Germany, Switzerland and Canada. Gold prices
continued to slide.
   The president of West Germany's central bank, Karl Otto Poehl,
helped put a lid on the dollar's rise by saying that his bank favors
a strong West German mark, and that there is no disagreement among
the United States, West Germany and Japan over dollar policy.
   The dollar rose last week in confused trading after Helmut
Schlesinger, Poehl's vice president, issued seemingly contradictory
statements that appeared to leave room for the U.S. currency to
climb.
   The dollar finished higher Monday than its Friday close against
all major currencies except the Japanese yen.
   The yen rose in concert with the Japanese stock market, which
posted its biggest gain in a year Monday amid a wave of pent-up
buying by small investors who had stayed out of the market during
the long illness of Emperor Hirohito. The emperor died Saturday.
   The dollar is strong because high U.S. interest rates make
dollar-denominated investments attractive to American and foreign
investors.
   Traders said President Reagan's release of his final budget
proposal had no impact on the currency market.
   ``The market's waiting to see what Mr. Bush is going to do, not
what Mr. Reagan's going to do,'' said Rick Lloyd, foreign-exchange
trading manager at Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles.
   The dollar got as high as almost 1.833 West German marks by the
opening of New York trading, said Angelo Mazzeo, a trader at
European American Bank in New York. Dollar sales and mark purchases
by the four central banks knocked it down after that.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7650 from $1.7797 late
Friday. In New York, the pound fell to $1.7733 from $1.7780 Friday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 126.08 yen from Friday's
125.97 yen. Later, in London, it rose further to 126.50 yen. In New
York, the dollar fell to 125.98 yen from 126.73 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.8203 West German marks, up from 1.8170; 1.5500
Swiss francs, up from 1.5483; 1.1994 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1973; and 6.2420 French francs, up from 6.1985; and 1,335 Italian
lire, up from 1,331 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.8245 West German marks, up from 1.8140; 1.5555 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5475; 6.2300 French francs, up from 6.1830; 2.0575
Dutch guilders, up from 2.0480; 1,339.75 Italian lire, up from
1,330.50; and 1.1955 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1912.
   Gold continued a monthlong decline that has knocked nearly $20 an
ounce off its price since early December.
   In Hong Kong, gold bullion fell $1.97 a troy ounce to close at
$407.18 an ounce.
   Gold bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $402.75 a troy
ounce, down from $405.75 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, Switzerland, gold fell to a late bid of $402.75 an
ounce from $405.50 Friday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $404.90 a troy ounce from $406.30 an ounce late
Friday.
   Later, Republic National Bank of New York said gold bullion was
bid at $404.50 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $406.25 an ounce.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a bid price of $5.94 a troy
ounce, down from $5.97 bid late Friday. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery fell to $5.963 a troy ounce from $5.988
Friday.

<TEXT>
   Teledyne Inc.'s fourth-quarter earnings fell
more than 38 percent from the same period last year, when investment
sales boosted earnings, the aviation, electronics and insurance
conglomerate said Monday.
   Fourth-quarter earnings totaled $98.2 million, or $8.68 a share,
compared to $158.8 million, or $13.60 per share, during the same
period last year.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 16.8 percent to $1.25 billion from
$1.07 billion in 1987.
   Profits for all of 1988 rose by about 4 percent to $391.8
million, or $34.03 a share, from $377.2 million, or $32.25 per
share, in 1987.
   For the year, sales rose 8.2 percent to $4.60 billion from $4.25
billion in 1987.
   Berkley Baker, assistant to the president of Teledyne, said the
drop off in the fourth quarter was not from operations.
   ``A year ago, we had sales of investments of $123.4 million. This
year it was just $21.3 million. That's a swing of $102.1 million,''
he said.
   Last year, Teledyne's insurance division sold all of its stock in
a company that was targeted for friendly takeover. A big chunk of
the quarter's $123.4 million in sales of investments came from that
transaction.
   In its earnings report, Teledyne said it was unsure what impact
an indictment against its Teledyne Electronics division in Newbury
Park would have on Teledyne earnings.
   Teledyne Electronics was accused in a 27-count indictment issued
in Alexandria, Va., on Friday of crimes including conspiracy,
bribery and theft of government property. The indictment was the
first issued as part of the Pentagon procurement investigation.
   If convicted, Teledyne faces fines of up to $6.5 million.
   ``We don't think the government has much of a case. We think we
will be acquitted,'' Baker said.

<HEAD>Speculators Flee Coffee Futures Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Speculators bailed out of the coffee futures market Monday in a
frantic, technically inspired sell-off on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp;
Cocoa Exchange although fundamental factors continued to point
toward higher prices.
   On other markets, frozen pork-belly futures plunged; soybean
futures fell sharply; precious metals were mixed; energy futures
rose; and stock-index futures advanced.
   Most coffee futures contracts settled 6 cents a pound lower, the
permitted daily limit for price movement. The limitless contracts
for delivery in March and May settled 9.43 cents and 8.75 cents
lower, respectively, with March finishing at $1.4829 a pound.
   ``What we saw today was a wholesale bailout of speculative
longs,'' or players who previously had bet that prices would rise,
said Kim Badenhop, a coffee-market analyst with Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets Inc.
   Analysts said that after reaching a 27-month high of $1.669 a
pound last Tuesday, profit-taking had brought the coffee market down
by Friday's close to levels that triggered Monday's sell-off.
   The surge in coffee prices during December was rooted in
tight-supply, strong-demand fundamentals, including a drought in the
coffee-growing regions of Brazil and the arrival of winter in the
Northern Hemisphere, the annual peak period for coffee consumption.
   Analysts said those factors remained in place.
   ``The long-term fundamentals suggest we would move to the upside
but it gets kind of scary when you get sell-offs like this,''
Badenhop said.
   Frozen pork bellies for both February and March delivery plunged
the 2-cents-a-pound limit on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
illustrating the market's potential for strong downward moves on
only moderately bearish news.
   The rise in supplies of frozen pork bellies last year to
near-record levels has caused a good deal of consternation among
analysts but has had little impact on prices.
   But Friday's quarterly hogs-and-pigs report from the Agriculture
Department, although by no means an overwhelmingly bearish report,
apparently was enought to trigger Monday's sell-off.
   The report showed a 2 percent increase over the previous year in
the number of pigs that producers expected to be born from December
through February.
   ``The baby pigs born in December, January and February are
slaughtered in June, July and August,'' said Tom Morgan, president
of Sterling Research Corp. in Arlington Heights, Ill. ``If the
December-February farrowings really do go up 2 percent, that means
the summer slaughter will go up 2 percent and that's bearish for the
bellies.''
   Hog and cattle futures finished mixed.
   Live cattle settled .30 cent lower to .20 cent higher with
February at 73.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .62
cent higher with January at 84.97 cents a pound; live hogs were .75
cent lower to .35 cent higher with February at 46.37 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 2 cents lower to .80 cent higher with
February at 42.45 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures fell as much as 12 cents a bushel on the Chicago
Board of Trade on forecasts for rain in Argentina, the world's
fourth-largest soybean producer, where early growing conditions have
been dry.
   Wheat and corn futures finished mostly higher, although those
markets also were pressured late in the trading session by the
Argentine rain forecasts. Oats ended sharply lower.
   Further selling of soybean futures was prompted by the
Agriculture Department's announcement late Friday that private
exporters had reported cancellations of sales of 240,000 metric tons
of U.S. soybeans for delivery to unknown destinations, which traders
and analysts said probably meant the Soviet Union.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 1{ cents higher with March at $4.48} a
bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to { cent higher with March at
$2.89\ a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 5 cents lower with March at
$2.37} a bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents to 12 cents lower with
January at $8.06{ a bushel.
   Gold and silver futures retreated modestly on New York's
Commodity Exchange in response to the early strength of the dollar,
but platinum futures rebounded on the New York Mercantile Exchange
after the dollar weakened late in the day.
   Gold settled $1.40 to $2.10 lower with February at $406.70 a troy
ounce; silver was 3.2 cents lower across the board with March at
$6.043 a troy ounce; platinum was $10.40 to $10.70 higher with
January at $533.80 a troy ounce.
   In energy trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas
Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 17 cents higher with
February at $17.72 a barrel; heating oil was .34 cent to .59 cent
higher with February at 54.15 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.05 cent lower to .24 cent higher with February at 47.96 cents a
gallon.
   Stock-index futures gained slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index settled .30 point higher at 283.70. Each point is
worth $500.

<HEAD>Highlights Of The President's Budget</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Monday sent Congress a
$1.15 trillion budget that is certain to be changed by
President-elect George Bush and a Democratic-controlled Congress.
   The plan would continue Reagan's legacy of military growth,
squeezed social programs, and optimism that the federal deficit will
disappear without a major tax increase.
   In his proposals for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, 1989,
Reagan advocated terminating a total of 82 government programs,
slashing spending on farm programs by $9.7 billion and trimming the
growth in Medicare and Medicaid, the giant health programs, by about
$5 billion. The Pentagon's budget, on the other hand, was awarded a
big spending increase.
   Here is a look at the major items:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>MILITARY</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's proposed budget would escalate ``Star Wars''
research and move several big-ticket weapons into production, while
sustaining current levels of military forces.
   Reagan requested $315.2 billion in budget authority _ a 2 percent
increase after inflation _ for national defense in fiscal 1990.
   The defense budget envisions that $303 billion of the $315.2
billion will be paid out during the fiscal year. The balance
represents money that would be authorized for various programs but
not spent until later.
   Of the totals, $305.6 billion in budget authority and $293.8
billion in outlays is earmarked for the Defense Department. The
remainder _ $9.6 billion in budget authority and $9.2 billion in
outlays _ is contained in the Energy Department's budget to cover
nuclear warhead production and research work.
   Bush has talked of cutting the request so that it just matches
inflation instead of providing real growth.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>HEALTH AND SOCIAL</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Reagan proposed increasing spending for AIDS research and
prevention by 13 percent while reducing the growth of the Medicare
and Medicaid health programs by cutting payments to states,
hospitals and physicians.
   Overall, the budget of the Department of Health and Human
Services _ the largest federal department _ would increase 5.7
percent to $424.4 billion in fiscal 1990. HHS spending accounts for
about 37 percent of the federal budget.
   Medicare and Medicaid have been fueling the growth of the
department's budget.
   President Reagan said his proposed cutbacks would not reduce
benefits to the 56 million elderly, disabled and low-income people
in the two programs, but would force the states, which administer
Medicaid, and providers paid by Medicare to become more efficient
and reduce waste.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>EDUCATION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Bush, who promised to be ``the education president,'' will need
to rework this proposal to incorporate his ideas.
   The Reagan plan would eliminate two dozen federal education
programs while slightly increasing overall education outlays from
$20.6 billion this year to $21.2 billion in fiscal 1990.
   Some $541 million saved by the cuts, plus another $212 million
from cost savings officials hope to achieve from the guaranteed
student loan program, would go to expand existing programs for
disadvantaged students from kindergarten to graduate school.
   The Bush ideas not incorporated into this budget include a $500
million merit schools program for schools serving disadvantaged
children and a $50 million infusion for a magnet schools program
designed to encourage parental choice.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>FARM</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Reagan wants a 19 percent cut in Agriculture Department spending
in the 1990 fiscal year, including cutbacks in farm commodity
programs and the likelihood of even deeper reductions in the future.
   Other proposed cuts for the fiscal year include spending for
forestry, farm loan programs, community and rural development and
some child nutrition programs.
   Under the proposed budget to operate USDA in the year that will
begin Oct. 1, total spending would be held to $42.4 billion, down
from the estimated outlays of $52.1 billion in the current fiscal
year.
   Spending on the department's Commodity Credit Corp. programs,
which includes wheat, corn and other major crop supports, would
decline to a six-year low of less than $11.6 billion from more than
$13.8 billion in 1989.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>WATER PROJECTS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The administration sought funds for 10 new flood control and
navigation projects, including several Congress refused to launch
last year.
   It requested $88.5 million in its fiscal 1990 budget for the Army
Corps of Engineers projects. Six were in last year's Reagan budget,
but Congress refused to start any. The four new projects are in
Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>VETERANS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Congress was asked to approve a small increase for veterans'
medical care and pensions as the president proposed outlays of $29.9
billion for the new Department of Veterans Affairs.
   Outlays for the Veterans Administration, which provided benefits
and services to veterans for 58 years, are estimated to be $29.2
billion in fiscal 1989.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>SPACE AND SCIENCE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The controversial space station program would get $2.1 billion in
spending authority in 1990, along with an extraordinary three-year
advance commitment for billions more.
   The suggested spending limit for the space station during the 12
months beginning Oct. 1 is more than double this fiscal year's limit
of $900 million for building the huge station.
   In general, Reagan's budget is generous to big science,
supporting not only the $16 billion space station but also the $4.4
billion superconducting supercollider proposed by the Department of
Energy.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>SAVINGS AND LOANS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The savings and loan crisis was dumped into the lap of Bush,
acknowledging for the first time the government does not have enough
money to bail out the troubled industry.
   The administration, in its proposed budget for fiscal year 1990,
outlined plans to spend $64 billion from the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corp., from 1989 through 1994. Of that, $16 billion
would be spent in fiscal 1989, which began last Oct. 1; $9 billion
in 1990, and $39 billion from 1991 through 1994.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>NUCLEAR</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Reagan proposed increasing by half a billion dollars the down
payment on modernizing and cleaning up the nation's atomic weapons
complex _ a job expected to cost $81 billion over the next 20 years.
   In his proposed fiscal 1990 budget for the Energy Department,
which makes the nuclear bombs and warheads for the Pentagon, Reagan
asked for $3.014 billion for moderninizing, environmental and safety
programs at the weapons plants. That is $478 million more than is
being spent on them this year.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>TRANSPORTATION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The administration is proposing $28.2 billion in spending for
fiscal 1990, an increase of some $200 million. Requested funds for
air transportation would increase by about $1 billion, with the
largest chunk going to modernize the air traffic control system.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>FOREIGN AID</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The administration asked for $13.2 billion in outlays for foreign
aid, with $3 billion in spending authority earmarked for military
and foreign assistance to Israel, while Egypt was to receive $2.3
billion. For the first time since 1986 the budget also asks for
enough money to cover the entire U.S. contribution to the United
Nations and other international organizations.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>JOBS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Outlays for job training and other employment assistance would be
$6.15 million under the 1990 budget, down by $74,000 in the current
year.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>WHITE HOUSE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Reagan wants to spend $28.5 million for the White House office,
compared to $27.7 million in the current fiscal year. Spending for
the executive residence would be $6.3 million under the plan, down
from $6.5 million in 1989.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CENSUS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   While most federal agencies are struggling with spending cuts or
small increases, the Census Bureau would get nearly triple its
current amount under President Reagan's 1990 budget.
   But don't get too excited, it's only temporary.
   Reagan proposed Census Bureau spending of $1.47 billion for
fiscal 1990, up from about $250 million in 1988 and about $559
million in the current year.
   The reason: the ``decennial'' census.

<HEAD>Jury Dismissal Officially Ends WPPSS Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The massive securities fraud trial over
Washington Public Power Supply System's $2.25 billion bond default
officially ended Monday with formal dismissal of the jury.
   The trial had been expected to last at least a year, but
out-of-court settlements with all the defendants made the
proceedings unnecessary.
   The 11 women and seven men on the panel had sat in court for 32
days since Sept. 7 and heard 27 days of testimony from a single
witness, a WPPSS employee who was the liaison with 88 public utility
districts.
   Those districts had contracted with WPPSS to build the power
plants, which were abandoned unfinished in 1982. In 1983 WPPSS
defaulted on the bonds sold to finance the project.
   A class of more than 24,000 bond investors and Chemical Bank of
New York, a trustee for bondholders, sued more than 100 agencies,
consultants and individuals. They charged that the defendants
conspired to lie to prospective bond buyers.
   Many jurors said they followed U.S. District Judge William D.
Browning's instructions against forming an opinion on the case until
they heard all the evidence.
   However, Tucson meat cutter Filiberto Islas, 53, said he was
``kind of leaning'' toward the defendants, saying he heard nothing
that would indicate conspiracy or fraud.
   Don Valdez, 36, a Tucson elementary school teacher, said he
``couldn't really form an opinion'' based on the sole witness's
testimony.
   Juror Jane Gerdes said she would have liked to deliberate a
verdict but felt the settlements saved the court money and gave
bondholders some compensation.
   ``I was thinking that if they settled, it would be financially
better for everybody,'' she said.
   Browning told the jurors he felt the case ``would not have
settled had we not sat you down and started this trial. So your
service here was very valuable.'' He also praised them for
attentiveness to the complexities.
   By the time the jury heard opening arguments, 20 defendants
remained in the trial.
   With out-of-court settlements, the number had dwindled to one
defendant and the class plaintiff when the trial recessed Dec. 5 for
a month.
   Blyth Eastman PaineWebber Inc., the WPPSS former finanical
consultant, ended need for continuing the trial by agreeing to
settle out of court for $25 million.
   Browning still must hold hearings on the fairness of 16
settlements and how the money should be distributed. Those are
scheduled to be in the spring in Seattle, although a date has not
yet been set.
   A new trial would be ordered for the parties in any settlement
Browning might reject.
   With the three other settlements worth $107 million Browning had
approved in June, the settlements total $700 million, plus whatever
the plaintiffs can recover from $50 million in disputed insurance
claims.
   WPPSS will not pay any money as part of its settlement with the
plaintiffs. The state of Washington pledged $10 million and the
federal Bonneville Power Administration, the power broker for the
Pacific Northwest, agreed to pay $35 million into the settlement pot.

<TEXT>
   GTE Corp. announced Monday a
reorganization into six operating groups and the appointment of Kent
B. Foster as president of the largest group, GTE Telephone
Operations.
   GTE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer James. L. Johnson said
the six operating groups will report to President and Chief
Operating Officer Charles R. Lee.
   Johnson said the new corporate structure was ``a natural step in
the evolution of a more streamlined and efficient GTE, and is
reflective of of the constantly changing business environment.''
   Foster, 45, most recently served as group vice president of
telephone operations. He began his career with GTE in 1970.
   Last March, GTE began restructuring its telephone operations, its
largest business. Telephone operations account for about $12 billion
of the company's $15.4 billion in annual revenues.
   Tony Hamilton, a GTE spokesman, said Monday that the previous
restructuring divided operations into two categories with a layer of
staff support extending over both.
   ``What's happening now is some are being split out from under
telephone operations and the layer of staff support ... has been
eliminated, allowing each of these groups to report directly to the
president. The purpose of that is to make the responsiveness of each
of these groups a little better, a little faster,'' he said.
   The six operating groups, their headquarters sites and presidents
are:
   _GTE Telephone Operations Group; Irving, Texas; Foster. Consists
of the domestic telephone operating units, the General Office,
British Columbia Telephone, Quebec Telephone, the Dominican Republic
Telephone Co. and Data Services.
   _GTE Electrical Products Group; Danvers, Mass.; Dean T. Langford.
Includes U.S. Lighting, Lighting International, Lighting Products
and Precision Materials.
   _GTE Government Systems Group; Waltham, Mass.; Francis A. Gicca;
Consists of three operating units: Command, Control and
Communications (C3) Systems, Electronic Defense Systems and Tactical
Systems.
   _GTE Information Services Group; Tampa, Fla.; William E. Starkey.
Consists of Directories, Telecom, Commercial Services, Education
Services, Health Services and Interactive Services.
   _GTE Mobile Communications Group; Houston, Texas; Terry S.
Parker. Includes Mobilnet, Cellular Communications Crop., Airfone
and Paging.
   _GTE Spacenet Group; McLean, Va.; C.J. Waylan. Includes GTE's
satellite launching and operations businesses.
   GTE is a worldwide corporation whose three core businesses _
telecommunications, lighting and precision materials _ employ about
161,000 people in 44 states and 38 other countries.

<HEAD>GM Laying Off 100 at Reatta Factory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 100 General Motors Corp. Buick Division
workers will be laid off as the automaker cuts production of its
Reatta luxury two-seat car, a company spokesman said Monday.
   Larry Gustin said production levels at the Reatta Craft Center in
Lansing would be cut Feb. 13 from 56 to 42 cars daily.
   Some of the layoffs would come as early as Jan. 20 when the plant
is shut down for installation of a new paint process and some new
tooling for a Reatta convertible, Gustin said.
   There are about 780 employees currently at the plant, which
produces only the Reatta.
   Overly optimistic sales forecasts prompted the cutback, Gustin
said.
   ``The manufacturing operation had been set up in a more
optimistic mode than our forecasts,'' Gustin said, in part because
of yet-to-be seen convertible sales.
   Originally, the Reatta convertible was to be introduced late last
fall, but Gustin said company officials decided more development
time was needed and put off introduction of the soft top until fall
1989.
   Analyst Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co. International
Inc. of New York, said GM had ambitious production schedules during
the last three months of 1988. The monthly sales rates of Reatta
rose during the second half of last year compared with the first
half, to 480 cars a month from 272.
   Most of that increase came in the last quarter.
   Between Reatta's introduction Jan. 15, 1988, and the end of last
year, Buick dealers sold 4,514 of the cars.
   ``We have forecast 7,000 to 8,000 in sales for the '89 model
year,'' Gustin said.
   ``It's still a momentum-building car looking for a new market
niche,'' he said. ``I think the manufacturing side felt that we
would do better than that.''
   The front-wheel-drive Reatta, which retails for $26,700, has as
its only options a 16-way adjustable driver's seat and a power
sunroof. Standard equipment includes a keyless entry system,
anti-lock brakes, air-conditioning and leather seats.

<HEAD>Memorex Telex Signs Agreement To Own Half Of National Advanced Systems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Semiconductor Corp. has
agreed to sell half its mainframe computer business to Memorex Telex
NV for $250 million in cash and 4 million shares of Memorex Telex
stock, the companies said Monday.
   National Advanced Systems of Santa Clara, which will become a
joint venture of the two companies, is the largest distributor of
IBM-compatible mainframe computers and data-storage devices made by
Japan's Hitachi Ltd.
   Memorex Telex, based in Amsterdam, is the world's largest
supplier of IBM-compatible equipment such as terminals, data-storage
devices and communications equipment.
   The Dutch company is privately held, so the value of the 4
million shares that National Semiconductor would receive in the deal
is difficult to estimate.
   National Semiconductor's main business other than mainframes is
computer chips. The company said the sale of half of National
Advanced Systems would give it cash for future investment needs and
help the competitiveness of the mainframe unit.
   Under the deal, Memorex Telex would get an option to buy the rest
of National Advanced Systems at a later date.
   ``Even though this is being called a joint venture, I really
don't see that there's much doubt ... of the acquisition of NAS by
Telex somewhere down the road,'' said Bob Djurdjevic, president of
Annex Research Inc., a computer market intelligence firm based in
Phoenix.
   Memorex Telex has annual revenues in excess of $2 billion. It is
made up of the Memorex business, formerly owned by Burroughs Corp.,
and Telex Inc. of Tulsa, Okla. Tulsa remains the U.S. headquarters
of Memorex Telex.
   Djurdjevic said that since Memorex Telex already has a large debt
burden, it made sense for the company to pay partly with stock and
to stretch the expected purchase of NAS over a period of time.
   National Advanced Systems, which has annual revenues of $900
million, will operate as a separate entity with headquarters in
Santa Clara.
   ``This relationship should prove beneficial to both companies and
to our combined customer base,'' said Giorgio Ronchi, president and
chief executive officer of Memorex Telex. ``Through cooperative
programs, we will substantially enhance the worldwide PCM market.''
   Memorex Telex operates in 27 countries worldwide, with
distributor links in another 50 markets. It has some 2,200 employees
worldwide, including 1,200 in the United States.

   The Reagan administration made one final appeal
Monday to spend more for air safety and Coast Guard drug enforcement
while cutting funds for highways, urban mass transit, lightly
traveled airline routes and Amtrak.
   The Department of Transportation's proposed $27.3 billion outlay
for fiscal 1990 contains several familiar refrains, many of which
have met a deaf ear in Congress. One new proposal was for a new ice
breaker after two of four used by the Coast Guard were taken out of
service because of increasing maintenance costs.
   Outgoing Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley, at a news
conference, stressed the budget's proposed increases for aviation,
drug law enforcement and safety programs. But proposed cuts put the
overall total $207 million under fiscal 1989's expenditures.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Monday sent Congress his
final budget, a $1.15 trillion plan to continue his legacy of
military growth, squeezed social programs, and as-yet unrealized
optimism that the federal deficit will disappear without a major tax
increase.
   President-elect Bush praised the effort, but reiterated his
intention to alter its design within weeks. He is expected to seek
less military spending to make room for his priorities: a cleaner
environment, better education and child care. Then Congress will
rewrite it again.
   Like all his others, Reagan's ninth budget is out of balance. But
this deficit, at $92.5 billion, would be the smallest since the year
he took office. When fiscal 199 ends on Sept. 30, 1990, the
accumulated national debt will exceed $3 trillion _ three times what
it was eight years ago when Reagan took office promising a balanced
budget in three years.
   Reagan blamed Congress for his deficit reduction failures and
tried again to persuade it to eliminate many domestic programs. This
time, he proposed to save $4.9 billion by killing 82 of them _ many
previously preserved by Congress, like subsidies for mass transit,
rural development and export business.
   Farm subsidies and child nutrition programs would be cut by $9.7
billion. Limits would be placed on the growth in Medicare, which
provides health insurance for Social Security recipients, and
Medicaid, which covers poor people, saving $4.9 billion.
   But Social Security itself is unscathed.
   Military spending would increase $5 billion, to $303 billion, and
the nation would begin to build a permanent manned space station.
   About $6 billion would be raised by selling government assets,
and another $1 billion would come from increasing fees for various
government services. Several corporate taxes would be cut _ by a
total of more than $2 billion.
   The resulting $92.5 billion deficit would meet the $100 billion
target of the Gramm-Rudman, deficit-reduction law, and represents a
sharp reduction from the $161.5 billion the White House anticipates
in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
   ``This budget shows that a gradual elimination of the deficit is
possible without raising taxes,'' Reagan said in his budget message.
``It can be done in a reasonable, responsible way _ with discipline
and fairness. New taxes are not required.''
   Bush concurred.
   ``The budget submitted by President Reagan today is an excellent
budget which demonstrates clearly that the (deficit-reduction)
targets ... can be met and indeed exceeded without raising taxes,''
said Bush in a statement.
   ``Naturally, I support its intent,'' he continued. ``However, I
will continue to review it for possible amendments after I assume
the office of the presidency.''
   The Democratic-controlled Congress plans to relegate Reagan's
proposals to the status of reference books until Bush decides which
of it he will embrace and which he will change.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, labeled Reagan's
plan ``largely irrelevant,'' and House Speaker Jim Wright called on
Bush to announce his own plans soon.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., new chairman of the House Budget
Committee, saw no surprises in the document, which he called ``the
last will and testament of the Reagan administration.''
   ``The real question is whether the priorities of the outgoing
administration will be renewed or rejected by the new
administration,'' Panetta said.
   ``It provides a formula for a meaner, harsher America rather than
a kinder, gentler one,'' as Bush promised, said Senate budget
chairman Jim Sasser, D-Tenn. ``It would be a serious mistake for
George Bush to dress up Ronald Reagan's budget in slightly different
clothes and expect it to be the basis for constructive budget
debate,'' he said.
   Panetta and Sasser have been openly skeptical that Bush can
comply with the Gramm-Rudman law while keeping his campaign promises
and still avoiding a tax increase.
   House Republican leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., predicted Congress
would accept the Reagan budget's underlying assumption that the
economy will remain strong with moderate inflation and interest
rates. Reagan has been frequently criticized as too optimistic.
   Overall, the budget proposes collecting $1.059 trillion in
revenues and spending $1.152 trillion, leaving a deficit of $92.5
billion.
   One ingredient of Reagan's budget which automatically takes
effect, unless vetoed by Congress, is a 50 percent pay raise for the
cabinet, members of Congress, judges, and the federal government's
top managers.
   Elsewhere in the budget, but only if Congress approves, is a
proposed 2 percent pay increase for rank-and-file federal workers,
3.6 percent for the military. Federal pensioners would get zero,
their cost-of-living increase for next year canceled, although
inflation this year is running about 4.4 percent.
   The president's budget reflects the persistent demands on the
Treasury to bail out insolvent savings and loan institutions,
costing taxpayers $16 billion this year and $9 billion next year.
Some $80 billion might be needed over the next few years, but Reagan
leaves it to Bush to find the resources.
   The continuing banking crisis and last summer's drought were
among the chief reasonsthe administration's deficit estimate for the
current year was raised to $161.5 billion, up from $145 billion
estimated last August, according to Joseph R. Wright Jr., the
president's budget director.
   The budget also proposes $3 billion to clean up and modernize the
government's aging nuclear weapons plants. The Energy Department
estimates the project could cost as much as $128 billion over the
next two decades.
   For the military, Reagan sought to extend his influence halfway
into Bush's first term by submitting a two-year spending plan,
including sharp increases in spending on anti-satellite and
anti-missile weapons.
   Reagan asked for $315.2 billion in military spending authority
for fiscal 1990, of which $303 billion would actually be spent
before the end of the fiscal year. The spending authority includes
funding for long-term projects and weapons buying in future years.
   For fiscal 1991, the president requested $330.8 billion in budget
authority and $314.4 billion in actual outlays.
   On the domestic side, the president proposed spending increases
in select areas, including aviation safety, toxic waste cleanups and
the search for a cure for AIDS. The $1.4 billion increase in the
space program includes money to begin building the space station and
launch 9 shuttle flights, and the budget also includes $250 million
to start work on a superconducting, supercollider physics laboratory.
   The Reagan budget includes no general tax increase, although $1
billion in new fees would be imposed for a variety government
services, including a 1 percent increase in the charge for veterans'
home loan guarantees.
   Commercial and recreational boaters would have to pay a $25
annual fee for using waterways patrolled by the Coast Guard. A
scheduled cut in aviation taxes would be canceled.
   All state and local government workers would be required to pay
the Medicare tax, raising about $2 billion.
   Meanwhile, corporate taxes would be cut under several proposals,
including a $1.7 billion tax break for corporations operating abroad.
   Reagan told a business group Monday that because of the current
economic expansion, ``the revenue is literally rolling in.'' The
$370 billion in additional taxes expected because of the bigger
economy by 1994 means ``plenty of money to do the business of
government.''
   ``Raising taxes would be the surest way of killing the economic
goose that lays the golden egg,'' the president said.
   In his eight years in office, Congress passed and Reagan signed
13 separate tax increases that will cost taxpayers $150 billion
during the next budget year. Reagan-era tax reductions will save
taxpayers $377 billion next year, according to the budget documents.

<HEAD>Prime Warns Hostile Takeover Could Drive Away Customers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Computer Inc.'s president told securities
analysts Monday the computer maker's operating income could rise as
much as 50 percent in 1989, but only if it wards off a hostile $970
million takeover bid by MAI Basic Four Inc.
   ``We have received expressions of concern from a number of our
large customers ... about the highly leveraged entity that would
result from a takeover and whether they would still buy from such a
vendor,'' Prime chief executive Anthony Craig said in an interview
after the meeting.
   Wall Street analysts said Craig told them that Prime could lose
$40 million to $100 million in orders if it is acquired by MAI
Basic, a Tustin, Calif.-based computer company controlled by New
York investor Bennett S. LeBow.
   ``It was stated quite harshly, but in terms of the numbers, it
wasn't a fall-off-the-chair impact,'' said Barry Willman, who
follows Prime for Sanford Bernstein &amp; Co.
   Said Willman, ``$40 million to $100 million to my mind isn't that
much, in terms of the corporation,'' which reported sales of $1.16
billion in the first three quarters of 1988.
   Prime stock closed at $19.25, up 12{, on relatively heavy trading
of 580,000 shares.
   MAI Basic spokesman Peter Rosenthal said the firm would not
comment on Craig's remarks.
   A Massachusetts judge temporarily enjoined MAI Basic on Dec. 29
from pursuing its $20-per-share cash tender offer, saying LeBow had
failed to make full disclosure of his financing arrangements with
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. But MAI Basic said it would go back to
court this month to submit further information and try to clear the
bid, which totals $970 million.
   Craig said the main purpose of the meeting with analysts was to
``give a good news flash on our expected fourth quarter earnings''
because ``there had been divergent estimates in the absence of
information.''
   The 43-year-old executive, who was named in October to succeed
Joe M. Henson as Prime's president, said fourth-quarter revenue is
expected to increase by 7 percent to 10 percent from $391.4 million
in the prior quarter. Net income is expected to rise more than 40
percent over the third quarter's $11.7 million, he said.
   Craig said Prime has completed its acquisition of General
Electric's Calma subsidiary, giving the company approximately 800
new customers and $60 million to $70 million in revenue in 1989.
   Prime announced Dec. 28 it would eliminate 1,200 jobs in 1989,
bringing its worldwide work force down to about 11,600. The company
also cut 700 employees last year after buying Computervision Inc.
for $435 million.
   Craig said the 1988 restructuring succeeded in rolling back costs
by about $50 million, and that Prime expects to cut costs by a
similar amount again this year.
   He told the analysts he expects a 6 percent to 8 percent increase
in revenue this year and a 10 percent to 12 percent rise in 1990,
primarily because of strong growth in sales of computer-aided design
and manufacturing systems.
   The combination of sharp cost cutting and revenue growth, he
said, could produce a 40 percent to 50 percent increase in operating
income in 1989 and a 20 percent to 30 percent increase in 1990.

<HEAD>Ford Recalls Heavy Duty Trucks, Sables</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS lead with 2 grafs to CORRECT that Sables not being recalled
to install omitted parts.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. on Monday recalled about
300 of its 1988 heavy-duty trucks to install parts omitted during
assembly.
   The automaker also recalled about 25,000 of its Mercury Sable
cars to change light bulbs in the vehicles' side marker lamps.
   Ford said in a news release that the trucks, 1988 models of the
F-250 HD four-wheel-drive vehicles, were assembled without fuel
reservoir shields, which are required by federal safety standards.
   The shield protects the fuel tank in a 30-mph front-end crash.
The company said it knew of no accidents, fires or injuries because
of the omission in the trucks, which are more than 8,500 pounds in
gross weight.
   Meantime, the company also recalled 25,000 Sables because a clear
bulb, instead of an amber one, was installed in side marker lamps.
   Owners of the affected vehicles will be notified by mail and
problems will be corrected free of charge, the company said.
